#title "Isaiah xli, 1-4"

"Keep silence before Me, O island, and let the people renew their strength; let them come near, then let them speak; let us come near together to judgement. Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to His foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? He gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven subble to his bow. He pursued them, and passed safely, even by the way that he had not gone with his feet. Who has wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, the Lord, the first, and with the last: I am He."
