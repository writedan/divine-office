From a homily of blessed Gregory, pope of Rome.

Out of these words of the reading, beloved brethren, the humility of John is commended to us, whereby while he was of such virtue that it was thought he might be the Christ, yet he chose firmly to stand as he really was, lest human opinion were forced vainly upon him. 

"For he confessed and did not deny, and he confessed, 'I am not the Christ.'" But since he has said "I am not", he has plainly denied, that he was not, however he has not denied what he was, that his very truth-speaking made him a member of him whose title he would not falsely usurp.
