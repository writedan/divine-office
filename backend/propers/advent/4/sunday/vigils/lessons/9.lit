But when John was asked he said, "I am not Elijah." What is this beloved brethren, because that the Truth affirms, the same the prophet of the Truth denies? There is indeed a great difference between "This is he" and "I am not." In what way therefore is he the prophet of the Truth if his words themselves are not in harmony with the Truth? But if the Truth itself be more minutely sought, it shall be found that this which in itself sounds contrary has no real contradiction. For to Zachariah concerning the promise of John the angel said, "He shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah." Who therefore shall come in the spirit and power of Elijah is spoken of, because just as Elijah shall come before the second advent of the Lord, so did John come before the first. As the former will be the precursor of the Judge, so the other was the precursor of the Redeemer.
