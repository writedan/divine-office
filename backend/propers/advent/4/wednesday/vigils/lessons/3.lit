#title "Isaiah li, 7-8"

"Hearken unto Me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My law; fear not the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation from generation to generation."
