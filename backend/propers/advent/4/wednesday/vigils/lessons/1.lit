#title "Isaiah li, 1-3"

"Hearken to Me, you who follow after righteousness, you who seek the Lord: look unto the rock from whence you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence you are dug. Look unto Abraham your father and unto Sarah who bore you; for I called him alone, and blest him and increased him." 

For the Lord shall comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places, and He will make her wilderness like Eden and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found thererin, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.
