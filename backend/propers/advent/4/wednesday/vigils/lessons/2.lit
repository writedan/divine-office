#title "Isaiah li, 4-6"

"Hearken unto Me, My people, and give ear unto Me, O My nation; for a law shall proceed from Me, and I will make My judgment to rest as a light of the people. My righteousness is near; My salvation is gone forth, and My arms shall judge the people. The isles shall wait upon Me, and on My arm shall they trust. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they who dwell therein shall die in like manner. But My salvation shall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be abolished."
