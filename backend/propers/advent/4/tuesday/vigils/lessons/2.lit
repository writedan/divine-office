#title "Isaiah xlii, 5-7"

Thus says God the Lord, He Who created the heavens and stetched them out, He Who spread forth the earth and that which comes out of it, He who gives breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them who walk therein: "I, the Lord, have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them who sit in darkness out of the prison house."
