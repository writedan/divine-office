#title "Isaiah xlii, 10-13"

Sing unto the Lord a new song and His praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea and all that is therein, the isles and the inhabitants thereof. Let the wilderness and the cities threof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit. Let the inhabitants of the rock sing; let them shout from the top of the mountains. Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the islands. The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man; He shall stir up jealousy like a man of war. He shall cry, yea, roar; He shall prevail against His enemies.
