#title "Isaiah xlii, 1-4"

"Behold My servant, whom I uphold, My elect, in whom My soul delights: I have put My Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench; He shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, until He has set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for His law."
