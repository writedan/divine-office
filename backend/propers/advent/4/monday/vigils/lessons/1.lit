"But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham My friend. You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you from the chief men thereof, and said unto you, 'You are My servant; I have chosen you and not cast you away.' Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you; yea, I will help you; yea, I will uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness."
