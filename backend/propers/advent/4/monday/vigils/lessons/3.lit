#title "Isaiah xli, 14-16"

"Fear not, you worm Jacob and you men of Israel, I will help you," says the Lord and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. "Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff. You shall fan them, and the wind shall scatter them; and you shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel."
