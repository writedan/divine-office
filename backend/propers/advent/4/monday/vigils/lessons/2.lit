#title "Isaiah xli, 11-13"

Behold, all they who were incensed against you shall be ashamed and confounded; they shall be as nothing, and they who strive with you shall perish. You shall seek them and shall not find them, even them who contended with you. They who war against you shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying unto you, "Fear not, I will help you."
