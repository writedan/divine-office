#title "Isaiah lxvi, 13-18"

As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you, and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And when you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like a herb; and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward His servants, and His indignation toward His enemies.

For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with His chariots like a whirlwind, to render His anger with fury and His rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by His sword will the Lord plead with all flesh; and the slain of the Lord shall be many. 

"They who sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together," says the Lord. "For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall come that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come and see My glory."
