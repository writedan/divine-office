#title "Isaiah lxvi, 5-9"

Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word: "Your brethren who hated you, who cast you out for My name's sake, said, 'Let the Lord be glorified, when He shall appear to your joy', and they shall be ashamed." A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord who renders recompense to His enemies. "Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a manchild. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. Shall I bring to birth and not cease to bring forth?" says the Lord. "Shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb?" says your God.
