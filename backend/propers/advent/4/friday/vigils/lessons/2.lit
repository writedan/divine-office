#title "Isaiah lxvi, 10-12"

"Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all your who love her; rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn for her; taht you may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; they you may milk our, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory." For thus says the Lord, "Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream; then shall you suck, you shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees."
