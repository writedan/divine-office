#title "Isaiah lxiv, 5-7"

You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways. Behold, You are angry, for we have sinned; in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. And there is no one who calls upon Your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You; for You have hid Your face from us, and have consumed us because of our iniquities.
