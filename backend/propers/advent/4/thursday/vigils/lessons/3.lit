#title "Isaiah lxiv, 8-11"

But now, O Lord, you are our Father; we are the clay, and You our potter; and we all are the work of Your hand. Be not sorely angry, O Lord, neither remember iniquity forever; behold, see, we beseech You, we are all Your people. 

Your holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a desolation. Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned up with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
