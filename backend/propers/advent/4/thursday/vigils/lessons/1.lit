#title "Isaiah lxiv, 1-4"

O that You would rend the heavens, that You would come down, that the mountains might flow down at Your presence, as when the melting fire burns, hte fire causes the waters to boil, to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Your presence. When You did fearsome things which we looked not for, You came down, the mountains flowed down at Your presence. For since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, besides you, what He has prepared for him who waits for Him.
