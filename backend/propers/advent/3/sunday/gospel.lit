#title "Matthew xi, 2-10"

At that time: when John had heard in prison of the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and they said unto Him, "Are you He who sohuld come, or do we look for another?" Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go and show John again those things which you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up and the poor have the Gospel preached to them. And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me."

And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is writen, 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.'"
