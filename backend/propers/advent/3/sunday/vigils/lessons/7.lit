A homily of blessed Gregory, pope of Rome.

It is to be asked by us, beloved brethren, why John, a prophet and more than a prophet, who coming to the baptism of the Jordan has shown forth the Lord saying, "Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sin of the world," who, considering both his humility and his power of divinity, says, "He who is of the earth speaks of the earth, but he who comes from heaven is above all" because, having been put in prison, sending his disciples, he asks, "Are you he who should come, or do we look for another?" as if he knew not whom he has indicated, and as if he knew not of Him, the same who he has proclaimed to be, by prophesying, baptizing, and showing forth. But this question is quickly resolved if both the time and the order of the event be considered.
