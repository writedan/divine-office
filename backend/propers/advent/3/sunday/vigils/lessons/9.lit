And having been asked, the Lord, enumerating the powers of his miracles, concerning his own death forthwith has answered in humility saying, "The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me." Seeing so many and great signs and miracles, who could rather than being scandalized, instead be astonished. Why therefore has he said, "Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me," except to show with a clear expression the abjection and humility of his own death? As if he were openly to say, "I indeed work wonders, but I disdain not to endure humiliations."
