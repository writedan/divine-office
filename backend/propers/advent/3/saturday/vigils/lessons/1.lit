A homily of blessed Gregory, pope of Rome.

The time when the precursor of the Redeemer had undertaken the preaching of the word is indicated by the mention of the Roman political leaders and the kings of Judea, where is is said, "In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of the Lord come unto John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness." Because indeed that which is foretold came to pass, whereby some of the Jews and many of the Gentiles would be redeemed, by the king of the Gentiles and the princes of the Jews the time of his preaching is desnigated. Because moreover it was that the Gentiles were to be gathered together, and that Judea would be scattered for the offense of faithlessness, likewise the description itself of earthy principalities reveals this, seeing that both in the republic of Rome one is described as having been in charge, and in the kingdom of Judea the four parts were ruled over by as many. Indeed by the voice of our Redeemer is declared, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation."
