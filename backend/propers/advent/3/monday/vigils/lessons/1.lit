#title "Isaiah xxviii, 1-4"

Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which is on the head of the fat valleys of them who are overcome with wine! Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, who as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand. The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet; and the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower and as the early fruit before the summer, which when he who looks upon it sees; while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.
