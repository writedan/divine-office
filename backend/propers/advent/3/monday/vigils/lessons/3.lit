#title "Isaiah xxviii, 16-18"

Therefore thus says the Lord God: "Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; he who believes shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it."
