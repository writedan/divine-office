Then she entered the house of Zachary, and greeted Elizabeth whom she had known would give birth to the servant and precursor of the Lord. By no means as if uncertain from the prophecy which had been received, but that she would offer congragulations concerning the gift, which she had learned her fellow-servant had received. Not that the word of an angel, by testimony of a woman gave assent, but that the attentive young virgin should devote herself to ministry of a woman of advanced age.

Moreover, "when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the child leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit." Opening her mouth to salute blessed Mary, straightaway Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and John was filled likewise. Also by one and the same Spirit both were taught, that one recognized who it was greeting her, and that the mother of her Lord ought to be venerated with reverence, she understood that it was the Lord himself who was carried in the womb of the Virgin. And because he was not yet able, his soul leapt in salutation, and indicated how willingly and how devoutedly the duty of the youthful precursor was to be fulfilled, and before he was born, he related the coming of the Lord by the indications of which he was capable. For now the time drew near when would be fulfilled the word of the angel which he had said, because he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. 

"Elizabeth was therefore filled with the Holy Spirit, and she spoke out with a loud voice." Rightly with a loud voice, because she had learned of the great gift of God. Rightly with a loud voice, because Him whom she had known to be present everywhere, she now too perceived bodily at hand. And indeed by a loud voice, not so much is to be understood a clamorous as a devoted one.
