For we have learned in the reading of the holy Gospel, after she merited to be elevated by the visitation and the address of the angel, after she herself had learned that she would be honored by a heavenly birth, by no means did she put herself forward as if the heavenly gifts had been on her account, but that she might be fit for more and more divine gifts, she fixed her steps in the protection of humility of mind, answering the archangel who was proclaiming to her, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to your word."

And indeed from today's reading we have heard the same humility which she had presented to the angel, likewise she undertook to present to her fellow man that which pertains to greater strength, pertains likewise to lesser. Who indeed does not know that a virgin consecrated to God has a better rank than the wife devoted to a husband? Who should doubt that the mother of the eternal King should be rightly preferred to the mother of a solider? 

But yet herself mindful of the precept of scripture, "The greater you are, the more humble yourself in all things," as soon as the angel who was speaking to her had returned to heaven, she arises, and goes up into the hill country, and carrying God in the womb, the servant of God asks for a habitation, and also seeks reassurance. And aptly after the vision of the angel she went up to the hill country, where having tasted the humility of heavenly citizens, by her steps she went across to the heights of virtue.
