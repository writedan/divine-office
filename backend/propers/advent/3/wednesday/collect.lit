Grant, we beg of you, almighty God, that the approaching solemnity of our redemption may both afford us succor in this present ~life~, ~and~ heap on us the rewards of eternal ~blessed~ness. Through the same Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for all ages of ages.
