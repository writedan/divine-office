A homily of the Venerable Bede.

The reading of today's holy Gospel, beloved brethren, commends to us the beginning of our redemption, wherein the angel sent from heaven by God tells the Virgin that the extraordinary nativity of the Son of God in flesh was to be proclaimed, by which we, cast down by ancient sin, are restored and also are able to be counted among the sons of God. That therefore we may merit to receive the gifts according to the promise of salvation, let us undertake to perceive its origin with earnest ear.

"The angel Gabriel," it says, "was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph." It was proper for the beginning of the restoration of mankind that the angel should be sent from God to a virgin who would be consecrated by a divine birth, because the first cause of human perdition was when the serpent was sent from the devil to a woman to be deceived through a spirit of arrogance. More correctly, the devil himself came in the serpent, which having deceived the first parents, stripped the human race of the glory of immortality. Because therefore death had entered through a woman it was apt that life return through a woman. That one, seduced by the devil through the serpent, offered to man the taste of death; this one, informed by God through an angel, provided the Author of salvation to the world.
