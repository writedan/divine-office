#title "Isaiah xv, 7-12"

And He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the rebuke of His people shall He take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is te Lord; we have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation." For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under Him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill. 

And He shall spread forth His hands in the midst of them, as he who swims spreads forth his hands to swim; and He shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. And the fortress of the high fort of your walls shall He bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.
