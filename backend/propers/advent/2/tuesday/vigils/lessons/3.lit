#title "Isaiah xiv, 12-15"

"How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How are you cut down to the ground, who weakened nations! For you have said in your heart, 'I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.'" Yet you shall be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
