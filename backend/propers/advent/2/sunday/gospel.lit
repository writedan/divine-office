#title "Luke xxi, 25-33"

At that time, Jesus said to his disciples, "There shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and upon the earth distress among nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring. Men's hearts will fail them for fear and for looking upon those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near."

And He spoke to them a parable, "Behold the fig tree and all the trees. When they now shoot forth, you see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand. So likewise you, when you see these things come to pass, know that the Kingdom of God is near at hand. Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away, until all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away."
