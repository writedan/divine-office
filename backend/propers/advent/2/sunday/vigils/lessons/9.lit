These things, brethren, we therefore say, that your minds may be awake to a zeal for caution, that they be neither torpid for security, not languish in ignorance, but that fear may always arouse them, and that anxiety may confirm them in doing good works. Considering this which is added by the voice of our Redeemer, "Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken." What else indeed does the Lord call powers of heaven if not angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers? Who at the coming of the strict judge shall then appear visibly to our eyes, that then they may sternly examine us, in these things of ours which at the present the invisible Creator patiently bears.

Whereto is added, "And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with power and great glory." As if he plainly said, "THey shall see coming in power and majestty," him whom, placed in humility, they refused to hear, and so much by his power they shall then feel his severity, as at present they refuse to bend the neck of the heart before his patience.
