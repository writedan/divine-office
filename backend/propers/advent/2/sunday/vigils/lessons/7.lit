From a homily of blessed Gregory, pope of Rome.

Our Lord and Redeemer, desiring to find us prepared, warns us of the evils that are to accompany the world as it grows old, that he may keep us from the love of it. He makes known what great commotions will come to pass at the approaching of the end of it, that if we be unwilling to fear God in time of tranquility, we may at least be scourged by the commotions into fearing judgment when it is at hand.

Indeed in this lection of the holy Gospel, a little before the Lord has forewarned, saying, "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places, and famines, and pestilences." Then after several more verses, this he added as you have heard, "There shall be signs in the sun, and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring."
