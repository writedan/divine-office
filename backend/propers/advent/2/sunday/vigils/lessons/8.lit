Surely from all these things we discern that some already have been accomplished, and some that we dread shall be coming soon. "For there shall arise nation against nation, and of their distress upon the earth and of their oppressions that shall prevail upon the earth," we discern more now in our tribulations than we have read of them in books. You know how often we have heard that earthquakes undermine innumerable cities in other parts of the World. Pestilences we suffer without respite. 

However, signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars hitherto very little do we see clearly, but that these are not far off we deduce even now by the change of the weather. However, extraordinary confusion of the sea of the tides has not yet arisen. But seeing that much that has been foretold has now been fulfilled, it is without dobut that what little remains should also follow, because, of the certainty of the things to follow, the past is the pledge.
