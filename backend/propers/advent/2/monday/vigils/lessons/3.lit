#title "Isaiah xiii, 9-11"

Behold, the day of the Lord comes, cruel, both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and He shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven and the constellations therefore shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

"And I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible."
