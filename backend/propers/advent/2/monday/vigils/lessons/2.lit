#title "Isaiah xiii, 4-8"

The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people! A tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together! The Lord of hosts musters the host of battle. They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the Lord and the weapons of His indignation, to destroy the whole land. Howl, for the day of the Lord is at hand! It shall come as destruction from the Almighty. Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt. And they shall be afraid; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them. They shall be in pain as a woman who travails; they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.
