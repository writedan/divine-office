#title "Isaiah xix, 1-2"

Behold, the Lord rides upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. "And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians; and they shall fight every one against his brother and everyone against his neighbor, city against city, and kingdom against kingdom."
