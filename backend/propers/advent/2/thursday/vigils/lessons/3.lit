#title "Isaiah xix, 11-13"

Surely the princes of Zoan are fools; the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh has become brutish. How do you say unto Pharaoh, "I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?" Where are they? Where are your wise men? And let them tell you now, and let them know what the Lord of hosts has purposed unto Egypt. The princes of Zoan are become fools; the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they woh are the stay of the tribes thereof.
