#title "Matthew xxi, 1-9"

At that time: when Jesus drew nigh unto Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage unto the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them, "Go into the village opposite you, and straightaway you shall find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them unto Me. And if any man say anything unto you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and straightaway he will send them." All this was doen that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prohpet, saying, "Tell the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King come unto you, meek and sitting upon a donkey, and a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.

And they brought the donkey and colt and put on them their clothes, and they set Him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut down branches from the trees and stewed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried out, saying, "Hosanna in the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"
