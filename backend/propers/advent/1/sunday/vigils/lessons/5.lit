It is not enough for us, then, to be content with his first advent: we must wait in the hope of his second advent. What we said at his first advent, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord," we shall repeat at his last advent. Running out with the angels to meet the Master we shall cry out in adoration, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." The Savior will come not to be judged again but to call to judgment those who called him to judgment. He who was silent when he was first judged will indict the malefactors who dared to perpetrate the outrage of the cross and say, "These things you did and I was silent." He first came in the order of divine providence to teach men by gentle persuasion, but when he comes again they will, whether they wish it or not, be subjected to his kingship.
