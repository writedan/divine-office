#title "Isaiah v, 1-6"

Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning His vineyard: my well-beloved has a vineyard on a very fruitful hill. And He fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine; and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein. And He looked for it to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between Me and My vineyard. What could have been done more to My vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I looked for it to bring forth good grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

And now, I will tell you that I will do to My vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor dug, but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
