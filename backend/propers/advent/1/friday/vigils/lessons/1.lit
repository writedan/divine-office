#title "Isaiah iv, 5-6"

And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory shall be a defense. And there shall be a tabernacle for shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.
