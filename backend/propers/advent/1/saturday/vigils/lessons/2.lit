#title "Isaiah v, 15-17"

And the lowly man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled. But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God who is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. Then shall the lambs feed according to their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
