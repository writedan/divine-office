#title "Isaiah iii, 13-17"

The Lord stands up to plead and stands to judge the people. The Lord will enter into judgment with the elders of His people and the princes thereof, "For you have eaten up the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor in your houses. What mean you that you beat My people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor?" says the Lord God of hosts.

Moreover the Lord says, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet, therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will uncover their secret parts."
