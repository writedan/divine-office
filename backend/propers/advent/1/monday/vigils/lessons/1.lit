#title "Isaiah i, 16-20"
"Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Cease to do evil, learn to do well. Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless, plead for the widow."

"Come now, and let us reason together," says the Lord. "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword," for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.
