#title "Isaiah i, 27-31"
Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness. 

And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they who forsake the Lord shall be consumed. For you shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen. For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water. And the strong shall be as tinder, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
