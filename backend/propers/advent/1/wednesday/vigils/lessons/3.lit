#title "Isaiah iii, 6-12"
When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, "You have clothing; be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand," in that day he shall swear, saying, "I will not be a healer, for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: Make me not a ruler of the people."

For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of His glory. The show of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they hide it not. Woe unto their soul, for they have rewarded evils unto themsevles.

Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruits of their doings. Woe unto the wicked; it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him. As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O My people, they who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.
