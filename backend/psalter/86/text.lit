#title "A Canticle Psalm, for the Sons of Korah"

On the holy mountain stands the city He founded; + the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob; * glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God.

Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon, * and the foreigners and Tyre and the people of the Ethiopians, these were born there.

A man will say, "Mother Zion," and, "That man was born in her", * and, "The Most High Himself has founded her."

The Lord shall tell it in the records of the nations and the princes + even these who were born in her, * "How joyous are all they who have their habitation in you."
