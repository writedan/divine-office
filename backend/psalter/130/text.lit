#title "An Ode of Ascents"

O Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are my eyes become lofty * nor have I walked in things too great or too marvelous for me.

If I were not humble-minded but exalted my soul as one weaned from his mother, * You would take revenge upon my soul.

Let Israel hope in the Lord, * from henceforth and forevermore.
