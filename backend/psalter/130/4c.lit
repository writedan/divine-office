#title "An Ode of Ascents"

(O) (Lord), my heart is not exalted, nor are my eyes ~be~come `lof`ty * nor have I walked in things too great or too marve`lous` for me.

If I were not humble-minded but exalted my soul as one weaned ~from~ his `mo`ther, * You would take revenge u`pon` my soul.

Let Isra~el~ hope `in` the Lord, * from henceforth and for`ev`ermore.
