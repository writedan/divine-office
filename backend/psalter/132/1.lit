#title "An Ode of Ascents"

(Be)(hold) now, what is so good `or` so `joy`ous * as for brethren to dwell toge~ther~ in `un`ity?

It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head which runs `down` u`pon` the bread, * upon the beard of Aaron, whih runs down to the fringe ~of~ his `gar`ment.

It is like the `dew` of `Her`mon, * which comes down upon the moun~tains~ of `Zi`on.

For there the Lord com`mand`ed his `bless`ing, * and ~life~ for`ev`ermore.
