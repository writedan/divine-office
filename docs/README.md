# Order of the Chapel

These norms presume all ministers are laity.

## Liturgical Books

The liturgical year is divided into eight volumes (the eighth volume being the votive offices of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of the Dead). These volumes each contain these books:

1. The **collectary**, which contains the material used by the minister alone or the minister and the congregation where he is unable to have access to one of the antiphonaries. It especially includes the collects, versicles, absolutions, and benedictions. It also contains an appendix holding the Gospels to be read at Vigils, if there is no evangeliary available.
2. The **capitulary**, which contains the short chapters and their responsories for all hours, but excludes the longer lessons of the Vigils.
3. The **lectionary** contains these lessons and their responsories.
4. The three antiphonaries:
	* The **nocturnal**, containing the antiphons, psalms, responsories, versicles, and hymns of the Vigils.
	* The **dirunal**, containing the same for Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, and None.
	* The **vesperal**, containing the same for Vespers and Compline.
5. The **processional**, containing the inviatatories of the Vigils and some other material as appropriate.

Each of these books is rather lengthy for each volume, but I am confident they have been truncated to the greatest extent possible. There absolutely only need be one of each book, but I recommend that the antiphonaries be the  liturgical book used by the congregation to meaningfully participate in the office.

Each of these books, when completed, will be linked here as a PDF in booklet form, i.e. there will be two pages on each sheet.

## Ministers of the Liturgy

These are the essential ministers:

1. The **minister** or **officiant**, who presides over the celebration of the hours and begins versicles and makes collects and the like.
2. The **precantor** and **succentor**, who intone antiphons and psalms and are the foremost responsible for the chanting of the liturgy.
3. The **lector**, who reads the chapters and intones their responsories.

In dire circumstances, which should not be tolerated in the long-run, it is permissible to merge the officiant and lector into one role, or even the precantor and minister with the succent and lector; but this should only be on an extraordinary and unexpected basis where no suitable persons are available.

To these, certain celebrations add the **rulers**, who range in number from one to three when appointed. When present, they intone all responsories, the antiphons to the *Benedictus* and *Magnificat*, they sing the inviatatory, and walk in all processions. If no suitable persons are available such that the rulers cannot be present, it is permissible to omit them and all their functions with them.

Wherever both possible and prudent, liturgical ministry ought to be restricted to men, but where greater solemnity may be achieved or prudence dictates otherwise, it is tolerable for women to serve in ministry. However, the ministries of lector and officiant ought to be reserved for men.

## Liturgical Vestments

All ministers ought to be vested with black cassocks, white fascia, and white surplice. The rulers, however, wear red fascia, but on penitential days (when the liturgical color is violet or black), they should wear purple. The officiant furthers wears a mantle in the liturgical color.

Women, however, should wear a white tunic, black scapular, white fascia (or red or purple if serving as a ruler), and a black veil. 

## Order in the Quire

The *quire* is the part of the church where the choir takes its place (pronounced the same). If there is a well-deliminated sanctuary, the quire should be two rows immediatelly before the altar; if there is not, the quire should be two rows on either side of the altar, or any other suitable arrangement.

If the church is orientated toward the east, then entering the quire from the west end facing east, the officiant's place is on the right and the lector on the left opposite him. Next to the officiant is the precantor, and opposite him on the left is the succentor.  When they are present, the rulers take their place between the nave and the quire. The odd number is always on the right.

Ministers should enter the quire at hours besides the Vigils with the precantor and succentor leading, following by the lector, followed by the officiant. They should always enter from the west, the cantors genuflecting before the altar, then taking their place, the lector likewise, but the officiant should kneel and thus begin the service with the silent prayers of recollection. After making the opening versicles, he also takes his place.

If the rulers are present, they lead this procession, and after genuflecting to the altar, go around and come up from the east to their places.

At the Vigils, rather, all the ministers begin at the baptistery (or the west end of the church) in the same order and process in solemnly while the rulers sing the inviatatory verses, but the whole procession should pause while the antiphon is repeated. But if there are no rulers present or appointed for that day, then only the officiant should process in from there while the cantors sing the inviatatory verses from their place.
