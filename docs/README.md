The liturgical year is divided into nine volumes, each volume containing four main books:
1. The **collectary**, containing the parts of the liturgy said by the priest or other officiant.
2. The **lectionary**, containing the readings of Vigils.
3. The **capitulary**, containing the readings for all the other hours, termed *chapters*.
4. The **antiphonary**, containing the psalms, antiphons, and hymns sung at each hour, which is usually divided into three books:
	1. The *nocturnal*, containing the hour of Vigils.
	2. The *diurnal*, containing the hours of Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, and None.
	3. The *vesperal*, containing the hours of Vespers and Compline.

Note the overlap in the VIII and IX volumes occurs because the IX volume properly begins with the first Sunday in August, which falls between the seventh and twelfth Sundays after Pentecost.
