The liturgical year is divided into seven volumes (an eighth contains the votive offices of the Blessed Virgin and of the Dead). Each of these volumes includes these four books:

1. The **collectary**, containing primarily the order of collects, versicles, absolutions, and benedictions used at the hours.
2. The **capitulary**, containing the chapters read at all hours excluding Vigils, along with their responsories when they are appointed.
3. The **lectionary**, containing the lessons of Vigils and their responsories.
4. The **antiphonary**, containing the antiphons, psalms, hymns, odes, and other such material, which is divided into three books:
	1. The *dirunal* for the hours of Lauds, Prime, Sext, and None.
	2. The *vesperal*, for the hours of Vespers and Compline.
	3. The *nocturnal*, for the Vigil hour.
