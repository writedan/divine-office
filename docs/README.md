## Liturgical Books

As explained on the landing page, the liturgical year is divided into eight volumes (the eighth volume being the votive offices of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of the Dead). These volumes each contain these books:

1. The **collectary**, which contains the material used by the minister alone or the minister and the congregation where he is unable to have access to one of the antiphonaries. It especially includes the collects, versicles, absolutions, and benedictions. It also contains an appendix holding the Gospels to be read at Vigils, if there is no evangeliary available.
2. The **capitulary**, which contains the short chapters and their responsories for all hours, but excludes the longer lessons of the Vigils.
3. The **lectionary** contains these lessons and their responsories.
4. The three antiphonaries:
	* The **nocturnal**, containing the antiphons, psalms, responsories, versicles, and hymns of the Vigils.
	* The **dirunal**, containing the same for Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, and None.
	* The **vesperal**, containing the same for Vespers and Compline.
5. The **processional**, containing the inviatatories of the Vigils and some other material as appropriate.

Each of these books is rather lengthy for each volume, but I am confident they have been truncated to the greatest extent possible. There absolutely only need be one of each book, but I recommend that the antiphonaries be the  liturgical book used by the congregation to meaningfully participate in the office.

Each of these books, when completed, will be linked here as a PDF in booklet form, i.e. there will be two pages on each sheet.

## Ministers of the Liturgy

These are the essential ministers:

1. The **minister** or **officiant**, who presides over the celebration of the hours and begins versicles and makes collects and the like.
2. The **precantor** and **succentor**, who intone antiphons and psalms and are the foremost responsible for the chanting of the liturgy.
3. The **lector**, who reads the chapters and intones their responsories.

In dire circumstances, which should not be tolerated in the long-run, it is permissible to merge the officiant and lector into one role, or even the precantor and minister with the succent and lector; but this should only be on an extraordinary and unexpected basis where no suitable persons are available.

To these, certain celebrations add the **rulers**, who range in number from one to three when appointed. When present, they intone all responsories, the antiphons to the *Benedictus* and *Magnificat*, they sing the inviatatory, and walk in all processions. If no suitable persons are available such that the rulers cannot be present, it is permissible to omit them and all their functions with them.
