=Tones=
I believe three symbols are necessary for notating each tone: one (~) for any preparatory syllables to be indicated on the first such, one (\`) for the accent itself, and one (^) for the flex accent where applicable.

I note that each tone has only two intoning syllables, no more than two accents, and presumably no more than 3 preparatory syllables before an accent. Thus, we need about 12 notes to fully note any tone.
