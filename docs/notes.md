= Divisons of the Volumes =

Due to the unexpected proxlity of Advent, which was originally to be grouped with Christmas in the first volume, I have deemed it necessary to review the whole. The six Sundays after Epiphany are equitable in their own volume, but these ought not include the Forelent, because the number of saints days possible is large, and the Forelent begins proper antiphons at Lauds and the other diurnal hours. Each day here also has a proper antiphon upon the Gospel canticle for all days of the week. And the Sundays use their own responsories at the minor hours, while the ferial is observed on feria.

Therfore, volume 1 is of Advent, from the first Sunday until the Eve of the Nativity, which begns volume 2, until the second Sunday after Epiphany. Volume 3, accordingly, begins with the third Sunday before Lent. Now here is a crossroads. Obviously, Ash Wednesday until the first Sunday in Lent ought be included with Volume 3 -- but what of Lent itself? It continues the same pattern, but new hymns and responsories have been introduced to the hours, but these are the same throughout the season. In the interest of not duplicating common, then also should the second week of Lent join them. But if this proves too much, then the first Sunday of Lent ought begin volume 4. 

Now, there are 10 saints days which can fall between the second Sunday after Epiphany and the first in Lent. In earlier years, two of these fall within Lent. This is compared to the 5 in the Advent books. I am extremely skeptical these could be made to fit, with the three Sundays before Lent and all their propers, with the Sundays after Epiphany and all the commons of ordinary time, into one book. Thus, it seems fit and just to have
Volume I 		(Advent)				
Volume II		(Christmas)
Volume III		(Time after Epiphany)
Volume IV		(Forelent until 3rd Lent)

Now, could the first two weeks of Lent be made to fit with Forelent? I am skeptical, but hopeful. This would make 5 weeks in one volume, compared to the 4 with Advent, but there is still (shockingly) less proper material. Now this would cover the days from January 18 to March 27. Fifteen(!) saints days can occur during that time. Of these, eight(!) even have proper psalms. This is significantly more than the Advent book, but it is worth a first attempt.

Certainly, the third and fourth weeks of Lent must be rendered their own volume. We will fit these until the Triduum into a Volume V.
Volume V 		(3rd Lent until Holy Thursday)
Volume VI 		(Triduum and 1st Week of Easter)
Volume VII 		(2nd Sunday of Easter until Pentecost)
Volume VIII		(Pentecost until 1st Sunday of August)
Volume IX		(August until Advent)
Volume X 		(Office of the Dead, Blessed virgin Mary)

With these, I certainly worry that there may be too many saints days in Volumes VIII and IX to accompany in a single volume, but there is no natural divison point for either, so this will have to be dealt with as is.

== Post Epiphany ==

Sarum appoints an octave for the Epiphany with a Sunday, and appoints nothing for the lessons after the Sunday, instead filling the gaps between the octave of the Epiphany and the following Sunday with the festivals of saints. The Roman use, however, has the epistles of Saint Paul read from the Sunday after Nativity until Septuagesima; Sarum compresses these into that Second Sunday after Epiphany until Septuagesima.

One is most tempted to maintan the octave, but without recourse to fulfilling the days between the octave-day and the following Sunday, will be difficult. 

I think the best solution is to eliminate the octave, i.e. we will celebrate the Epiphany and then continue with its octave-days until the First Sunday thereafter. On this date, we will begin the lessons from the Romans, Gospel of the Octave of the Epiphany, which is the baptism.

Another solution is to fill the dates from January 14-January 20, i.e. the week after the octave wherein a Sunday may fall, with saints days such that we do not need a ferial order for such days. I am not inclined to this solution because our sanctoral is otherwise moderate and well-curated.

The third solution is to use the propers of the Circumcision at the hours and read lessons about the Nativity until the Sunday occurs between January 14 and January 20. I do like this one because it maintains the octave of the Epiphany (one of four with Christmas, Easter, Pentecost). There would have to be six days, for which we could use the lessons given in the reformed rite for the days between Circumcision and a Sunday-fixed Epiphany. Hours celebrated as on the Circumcision, i.e. responsories and antiphons. Benedictus and Magnificat would use those left over from the octave of the Nativity. The only question is that of the collect, since these are divorced from any Sunday. I believe the "missing" collect from the Sundays after Epiphany from the Roman use (versus Sarum) works well here, especially if we use it for the Sunday after Epihpany which otherwise uses that of the Epiphany itself.

All the foregoing options are unsatisfactory in their own ways, but all are superior to the Roman custom of sustaining ferial readings throuh discordant sanctoral days, and moreover of beginning Romans within Christmas. 

It is therefore my determination to maintain the octave of the Epiphany, to be followed by up to six ferial days "in Christmastide", which will generally use the propers of the Circumcision, with proper lessons of Matins. Each day will be 3 lect.

== Post Pentecost ==

We have diverged from the authentic Sarum rite in a number of fashions, most prominently in the liturgical calendar. First, we have suppressed even the Feast of the Trinity and restored the Roman practice of the Sundays after Pentecost. Thus, what Sarum numbers as the First Sunday after Trinity, we hold as the First Sunday after Pentecost.

Now Sarum provides for 25 Sundays after Trinity, so for us 25 Sundays after Pentecost. However, years can have up to 27 Sundays after Trinity, and so 28 Sundays after Pentecost, until Advent. These, for us, three Sundays must be dealt with.

2022 has zero vacant weeks, 2021 has 1 vacant weeks, 2018 has two vacant weeks, and 2008 has three. These are the most recent years such things occur. 

Now, the 23rd, 24th, and 25th Sundays after Pentecost/Trinity all use the same materials frm the Mass, but have a proper Lesson, Alleluia, and Gospel, as well as, of course, collects. The Vigil lessons are, of course, by this time long since divorced from the Sunday cycle and follow their own based upon the months. So the only effect these have upon the office is the collect, and Benedictus/Magnificat antiphons.

Now the first solution is to desnigate some feasts to have octaves upon certai years and not others. But this leads, I think, to a certain undesierable flux in the liturgical year wherein for no discernable reason do we occasionally celebrate the Assumption or whatever else with more solemnity. 

Now since it is the custom of the Roman use to supplement the Sundays after Pentecost with those after Epiphany, and since the Sarum also recycles all but the lections in like maner as the 23rd, 24th, and 25th Sundays after Pentecost for the fourth, fifth, and sixth Sundays after Epiphany, I contend these lessons be read at Mass with the propers of those after Pentecost, as also their collects, and antiphons. This is one of two preferred solutions, and indeed the one taken.

Thus, there are 28 Sundays after Pentecost: the 28th is called the 25th after Trinity in the Sarum books, while the 1st-24th are called the 1st-24th after Trinity. The 25th, 26th, and 27th are respectively the 4th, 5th, and 6th Sundays after Epiphany (which Sarum notes as after the octave of Epiphany, thus decreasing each by 1).

28th = 25th after Trinity
27th = 6th after Epiphany (5th after octave)
26th = 5th after Epiphany (4th after octave)
25th = 4th after Epiphany (3rd after octave)
24th = 24th after Trinity
