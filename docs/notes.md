== Post Epiphany ==

Sarum appoints an octave for the Epiphany with a Sunday, and appoints nothing for the lessons after the Sunday, instead filling the gaps between the octave of the Epiphany and the following Sunday with the festivals of saints. The Roman use, however, has the epistles of Saint Paul read from the Sunday after Nativity until Septuagesima; Sarum compresses these into that Second Sunday after Epiphany until Septuagesima.

One is most tempted to maintan the octave, but without recourse to fulfilling the days between the octave-day and the following Sunday, will be difficult. 

I think the best solution is to eliminate the octave, i.e. we will celebrate the Epiphany and then continue with its octave-days until the First Sunday thereafter. On this date, we will begin the lessons from the Romans, Gospel of the Octave of the Epiphany, which is the baptism.

Another solution is to fill the dates from January 14-January 20, i.e. the week after the octave wherein a Sunday may fall, with saints days such that we do not need a ferial order for such days. I am not inclined to this solution because our sanctoral is otherwise moderate and well-curated.

The third solution is to use the propers of the Circumcision at the hours and read lessons about the Nativity until the Sunday occurs between January 14 and January 20. I do like this one because it maintains the octave of the Epiphany (one of four with Christmas, Easter, Pentecost). There would have to be six days, for which we could use the lessons given in the reformed rite for the days between Circumcision and a Sunday-fixed Epiphany. Hours celebrated as on the Circumcision, i.e. responsories and antiphons. Benedictus and Magnificat would use those left over from the octave of the Nativity.

== Post Pentecost ==

We have diverged from the authentic Sarum rite in a number of fashions, most prominently in the liturgical calendar. First, we have suppressed even the Feast of the Trinity and restored the Roman practice of the Sundays after Pentecost. Thus, what Sarum numbers as the First Sunday after Trinity, we hold as the First Sunday after Pentecost.

Now Sarum provides for 25 Sundays after Trinity, so for us 25 Sundays after Pentecost. However, years can have up to 27 Sundays after Trinity, and so 28 Sundays after Pentecost, until Advent. These, for us, three Sundays must be dealt with.

2022 has zero vacant weeks, 2021 has 1 vacant weeks, 2018 has two vacant weeks, and 2008 has three. These are the most recent years such things occur. 

Now, the 23rd, 24th, and 25th Sundays after Pentecost/Trinity all use the same materials frm the Mass, but have a proper Lesson, Alleluia, and Gospel, as well as, of course, collects. The Vigil lessons are, of course, by this time long since divorced from the Sunday cycle and follow their own based upon the months. So the only effect these have upon the office is the collect, and Benedictus/Magnificat antiphons.

Now the first solution is to desnigate some feasts to have octaves upon certai years and not others. But this leads, I think, to a certain undesierable flux in the liturgical year wherein for no discernable reason do we occasionally celebrate the Assumption or whatever else with more solemnity. 

Now since it is the custom of the Roman use to supplement the Sundays after Pentecost with those after Epiphany, and since the Sarum also recycles all but the lections in like maner as the 23rd, 24th, and 25th Sundays after Pentecost for the fourth, fifth, and sixth Sundays after Epiphany, I contend these lessons be read at Mass with the propers of those after Pentecost, as also their collects, and antiphons. This is one of two preferred solutions, and indeed the one taken.

Thus, there are 28 Sundays after Epiphany: the 28th is called the 25th after Trinity in the Sarum books, while the 1st-24th are called the 1st-24th after Trinity. The 25th, 26th, and 27th are respectively the 4th, 5th, and 6th Sundays after Epiphany (which Sarum notes as after the octave of Epiphany, thus decreasing each by 1).
