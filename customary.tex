		\begin{enumerate}
		
			\item There are seven orders of liturgical ministers: porters, cantors, lectors, acolytes, subdeacons, deacons, and presbyters. The first four are minor orders and only require deputation, even by necessity; the last three are the major orders which require either institution, in the case of the subdiaconate\footnote{Training as an acolyte in the Mass is sufficient.}, or ordination, as the case of deacons and presbyters.
			
			\item The celebration of the Mass must in all cases by served by a priest, assisted by deacon and subdeacon; the celebration of the hours is best overseen by a priest but may be licitly celebrated without any oversight by only one subdeacon, one lector, and at least two cantors.
			
			\item However, where extreme case arises where there is a lack of suitable ministers but the faithful still demand a liturgical celebration, the priest may licitly assume the roles of deacon and subdeacon; in the hours, the subdeacon and lector may assume additionally the roles of cantors. This should never be tolerated as a regular situation.
			
			\item Liturgical ministry is best reserved for men, but where this is inexpedient or imprudent, woman may licitly perform the ministries of porter and cantor. In extreme cases, even the ministry of lector may be performed by women, but that of acolytes, subdeacons, deacons, and presbyters must be reserved to men alone, by the divine law.
			
			\item Among those found willing and suited for liturgical ministry, the campus minister or his deputy chooses for the year the dean who is responsible for the maintenance of the liturgy according to the books and the organization of its ministers.
			
			\item Each week, the dean names a hebdomadary who assumes the ministry of subdeacon in the overseeing of the hours in absence of a priest.  The dean himself performs the ministry of subdeacon in overseeing the hours on all days ranked minor feast or higher; the first Sunday of Advent, Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, the Triduum, and the eve of Pentecost.
			
			\item The hebdomadary for each day of the week must ensure that there is at least two cantors and one lector for all the hours to be celebrated in the chapel. The hebdomadary himself performs the ministry of subdeacon in overseeing the liturgy in the usual case, but may name a replacement if he is unable.
			
		\vesectionp{Vestments of the Ministers}
		
			\item Woman, when serving in liturgical ministry, must always be vested in the black tunic, white scapular, white cincture, white coif, and black veil.
			
			\item Otherwise, the vestments used depend upon both the liturgical ministry as well as the character of the celebration. Common to all ministers at all times is the black cassock, white fascia or cincture, and the surplice.
			
			\item At the hours, cantors should wear additionally a red mantle,\footnote{When the liturgical color, however, is violet or black, these mantles should be violet.} lectors a black mantle, and acolytes a white mantle; the subdeacon and deacon should wear the tunicle and dalmatic in the color of the day, and the priest should wear the cope in the color of the day.
			
			\item At the Mass, let the same be among the minor orders, but the major orders should be vested also with albs and maniples; the deacon and priest both wear stoles but the subdeacon does not. 
			
			\item All ministers should be vested before entering the chapel. The rite of vestment is thus:
