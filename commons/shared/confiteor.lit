#instruction "The congregation says together the Confiteor."

I confess to almighty God and to all the saints that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed: through my fault, through my fault, through my own fault. Therefore I beseech blessed Mary, ever-Virgin, blessed John the Baptist, blessed Michael the Archangel, the holy apostles Peter and Paul, and all the saints to pray for me to the Lord our God.

#instruction "The officiant continues alone."

May almighty God +++ have mercy upon us and forgive us all our sins, deliver us from all evil, and bring us into everlasting life. Amen.
