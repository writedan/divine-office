%	Whose wisdom joined in meet array\\
%	The morn and eve, and named them day:\\
%	Night comes with all its darkling fears,\\
%	Regard thy people's prayers and tears.
%	
%	Lest, sunk in sin, and whelmed with strife\\
%	They lose the gift of endless life;\\
%	While, thinking but the thoughts of time,\\
%	They wave new chains of woe and crime.
%	
%	But grant them grace that they may strain\\
%	The heav'nly gate and prize to gain:\\
%	Each harmful lure aside to cast,\\
%	And purge away each error past.
%	
%	O Father, that we ask be done,\\
%	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son:\\
%	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
%	Doth live and reign eternally.
