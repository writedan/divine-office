	Whose wisdom joined in meet array\\
	The morn and eve, and named them day:\\
	Night comes with all its darkling fears,\\
	Regard thy people's prayers and tears.
	
	Lest, sunk in sin, and whelmed with strife\\
	They lose the gift of endless life;\\
	While, thinking but the thoughts of time,\\
	They wave new chains of woe and crime.
	
	But grant them grace that they may strain\\
	The heav'nly gate and prize to gain:\\
	Each harmful lure aside to cast,\\
	And purge away each error past.
	
	O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son:\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally.
