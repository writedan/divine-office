	O thou true Sun, on us thy glance\\
	Let fall in royal radiance,\\
	The Spirit's sanctifying beam\\
	Upon our earthly senses stream.
	
	The Father, too, our prayers implore,\\
	Father of glory evermore;\\
	The Father of all grace and might,\\
	To banish sin from our delight.
	
	To guide whate'er we nobly do,\\
	With love all envy to subdue,\\
	To make ill-fortune turn to fair,\\
	And give us grace our wrongs to bear.
	
	Our mind be in his keeping placed,\\
	Our body true to him and chaste,\\
	Where only Faith her fire shall feed,\\
	to burn the tares of Satan's seed.
	
	And Christ to us for food shall be,\\
	From him our drink that welleth free,\\
	The Spirit's wine, that maketh whole,\\
	And, mocking not, exalts the soul.
	
	Rejoicing may this day go hence,\\
	Like virgin dawn our innocence,\\
	Like fiery noon our faith appear,\\
	Nor know the gloom of twilight drear.
	
	Morn is her rosary car is borne;\\
	Let him come forth our perfect morn,\\
	The Word in God the Father one,\\
	The Father perfect in the Son.
	
	All laud to God the Father be,\\
	All praise, Eternal Son, to thee;\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To God the Holy Paraclete.
