	O ye who, throned in glory dread,\\
	Shall judge the living and the dead,\\
	True lights, the world illumining,\\
	Regard the suppl'ant prayer we bring.
	
	The gates of heav'n, at your command,\\
	To all be closed or open stand:\\
	May we, at your august decree,\\
	Be looses from our iniquity.
	
	The pow'r of old to your conveyed,\\
	Sickness and health alike obeyed;\\
	May ye our ailing souls once more\\
	To strength and holiness restore.
	
	That Christ, th' uerring Judge of doom,\\
	When he at time's last end shall come,\\
	May grant us, for his mercy's sake,\\
	Of joys eternal to parktake.
	
	All laud to God the Father be;\\
	All praise, eternal Son, to thee;\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To God the holy Paraclete.
