	And fowls in open air to be;\\
	That each, by origin the same,\\
	Its sep'rate dwelling place might claim.

	Be none puffed up with boastfulness:\\
	That contrite hearts be not dismayed,\\
	Nor haughty souls in ruin laid.
	
	O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally.
