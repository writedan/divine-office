	Glitters now the crown above thee,\\
	Figured in thy sacred name:\\
	O that we, who truly love thee,\\
	May have portion in the same;\\
	In the dreadful day of judgment\\
	Fearing neither sin nor shame.
	
	Laud to God, and might, and honor,\\
	Who with flowers of rosy dye\\
	Crowned thy forehead, and hath placed thee\\
	In the starry throne on high:\\
	He direct us, he protect us,\\
	From death's sting eternally.
