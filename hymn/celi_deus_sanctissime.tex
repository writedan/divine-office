	Thou, when the fourth day was begun,\\
	Didst frame the circle of the sun,\\
	And set the moon for ordered change,\\
	And planets for their wider range.
	
	To night and day, by certain line,\\
	Their var'ing  bounds thou didst assign;\\
	And gav'st a signal, known and meet,\\
	For months begun and months complete.
	
	Enlighten thou the hearts of men;\\
	Polluted souls make pure again;\\
	Unloose the bands of guilt within;\\
	Remove the burden of our sin.
	
	O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally.
