	The mighty forms that fill the land,\\
	Instinct with life at thy command,\\
	Thou gav'st subdued to humankind\\
	For service in their rank assigned.
	
	From all thy servants chase away\\
	Whate'er of thought impure today\\
	Hath mingled with the heart's intent,\\
	Or with the actions hath been blent.
	
	In heav'n thine endless joys bestow,\\
	But grant thy gifts of grace below;\\
	From chains of strife our souls release,\\
	Bind fast the gentle bands of peace.
	
	O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally.
