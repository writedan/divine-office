	Lord of creation, bow thine ear, O Christ, to hear\\
	The intercession of thy servant true and dear,\\
	That we, unworthy, who have trespassed in thy sight,\\
	May live before thee where he dwells in glor'ous light.
	
	O God, our Savior, look on thine inheritance,\\
	Sealed by the favor shining from thy countenance;\\
	That no false spirit bring to nought the souls of price\\
	Bought by the merit of the perfect Sacrifice.
	
	We bear the burden of our guilty and enmity,\\
	Until thy pardon lift the heart from slavery;\\
	Then through the spending of thy life blood, King of grace,\\
	Grant us unending triumph in thy holy place.
	
	To thee the glor'ous Christ, our Savior manifest,\\
	All wreaths victorious, praise and worship be addressed,\\
	Whom with the living Father humbly we adore,\\
	And the life giving Spirit, God, forevermore.
