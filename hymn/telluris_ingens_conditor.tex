	That so, with flowers of golden hue,\\
	The seeds of each it might renew;\\
	And fruit-trees bearing fruit might yield,\\
	And pleasant pasture of the field.
	
	Our spirit's rankling wounds efface\\
	With dewy freshness of thy grace:\\
	That grief may cleanse each deed of ill,\\
	And o'er each lust may triumph still.
	
	Let every soul thy law obey,\\
	And keep from every evil way;\\
	Rejoice each promised good to win,\\
	And flee from every mortal sin.
	
	O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally.
