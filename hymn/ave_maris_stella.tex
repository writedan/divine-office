	Greet us with the welcome\\
	By Gabriel spoken:\\
	Eva changed to Ave\\
	Be of peace the token.
	
	Plead for captive's freedom,\\
	Light on blindness pouring:\\
	Guard from every evil,\\
	Every bliss imploring.
	
	Christ of thee hath deigned\\
	To be born our brother:\\
	Spread our plea before him,\\
	Ask, as asks a mother.
	
	Virgin, all excelling,\\
	Passing meek and holy:\\
	Teach us thee to follow,\\
	Gentle, chaste, and lowly.
	
	In pure paths direct us,\\
	On life's journey faring,\\
	Till we gaze on Jesus,\\
	In thy gladness sharing.
	
	Father, Son, and Spirit,\\
	Three in One confession,\\
	Give we equal glory,\\
	Equal praise and blessing.
