	The pleasures of the world he spurned,\\
	From sin's pernicious lures he turned;\\
	He knew their joys imbued with gall,\\
	and thus he reached thy heav'nly hall.
	
	For thee through man 'a woe he ran,\\
	In man 'a fight he played the man;\\
	For thee his blood he dared to pour,\\
	And hence hath joy forevermore.
	
	We therefore pray thee, full of love,\\
	Regard us from thy throne above;\\
	On this thy martyr's triumph day,\\
	Wash every stain of sin away.
	
	All honor, laud, and glory be,\\
	O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee,\\
	All glory as is ever meet,\\
	To Father and to Paraclete.
