	O ye who, throned in glory dread,\\
	Shall judge the living and the dead,\\
	True lights, the world illumining,\\
	Regard the suppliant prayer we bring.
	
	The gates of heav'n, at your command,\\
	To all or closed or opened stand:\\
	May we, at your august decree,\\
	Be loosed from our iniquity.
	
	The pow'r of old to you conveyed,\\
	Sickness and health alike obeyed;\\
	May ye our ailing souls once more\\
	To strength and holiness restore.
	
	That Christ, unerring Judge of doom,\\
	When he at time's last end shall come,\\
	May grant us, for his mercy's sake,\\
	Of joys eternal to partake.
	
	All honor, laud, and glory be,\\
	O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee;\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To Father and to Paraclete.
