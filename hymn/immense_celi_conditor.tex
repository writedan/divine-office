	The floods above thou didst ordain;\\
	The floods below thou didst restrain:\\
	That moisture might attemper heat,\\
	Lest the parched earth should ruin meet.
	
	Upon our souls, good Lord, bestow\\
	The gift of grace in endless flow:\\
	Lest some renewed deceit or wile\\
	Of former sin should us beguile.
	
	Let faith discover heav'nly light;\\
	So shall its rays direct us right:\\
	And let this faith each error chase,\\
	And never give to falsehood place.
	
	O Father, that we ask be done,\\
	Through Jesus Christ, thine only Son;\\
	Who, with the Holy Ghost and thee,\\
	Doth live and reign eternally.
