	Lo, sages from the East are gone\\
	To where the star hath newly shone:\\
	Led on by light to Light they press,\\
	And by their gifts their God confess.
	
	The Lamb of God is manifest\\
	Again in Jordan's water blest,\\
	And he who sin had never known
	By washing hath our sins undone.
	
	Yet he that ruleth everything\\
	Can change the nature of the spring,\\
	And gives at Cana this for sign:\\
	The water reddens into wine.
	
	All glory, Lord, to thee we pray,\\
	For thine Epiphany today:\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To Father and to Paraclete.
