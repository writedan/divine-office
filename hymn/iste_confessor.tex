	God-fearing, watchful, pure of mind and body,\\
	Holy and humble, thus did all men find him;\\
	While, through his members, to the life immortal\\
	Mortal life called him.
	
	Thus to the weary, from the life enshrined,\\
	Potent in virtue, flowed humane compassion;\\
	Sick and sore laden, howsoever burdened,\\
	There they found healing.
	
	So now in chorus, giving God the glory,\\
	Raise we out anthem gladly to his honor,\\
	That in fair kinship we may all be sharers\\
	Here and hereafter.
	
	Honor and glory, power and salvation,\\
	Be in the highest unto him who reigneth\\
	Changless in heaven over earthly changes,\\
	Triune, eternal.
