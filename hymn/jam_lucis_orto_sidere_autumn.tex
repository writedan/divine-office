	Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;\\
	From anger's din would hide our life;\\
	From all ill sights would guard our eyes;\\
	Would close our ears from vanities.
	
	Would keep our inmost conscience pure;\\
	Our souls from folly would secure;\\
	Would bid us check the pride of sense\\
	With due and holy abstinence.
	
	So we, when this new day is gone.\\
	And night in turn is drawing on,\\
	With conscience by the world unstained\\
	Shall praise his name for vict'ry gained.
	
	All laud to God the Father be,\\
	All praise, Eternal Son, to thee;\\
	All glory, as is ever meet,\\
	To God the Holy Paraclete.
