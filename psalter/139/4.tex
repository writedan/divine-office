	Who imagine \textbf{mis}chief in their hearts * and stir up strife all the day \textbf{long}.
	
	They have sharpened their tongues \textbf{like} a serpent * adder's poison is under their \textbf{lips}.
	
	Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of \textbf{the} ungodly * preserve me from the wicked men, who are purposed to overthrow my go\textbf{ings}.
	
	The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a \textbf{net} abroad with cords * yea, and set traps in my \textbf{way}.
	
	I said unto the \textbf{Lord}, Thou art my God * hear the voice of my prayers, O \textbf{Lord}.
	
	O Lord God, thou strength of \textbf{my} salvation * thou hast covered my head in the day of bat\textbf{tle}.
	
	Let not the ungodly have his de\textbf{si}re, O Lord * let not his mischievous imagination prosper, lest they be too \textbf{proud}.
	
	Let the mischief of their own lips fall up\textbf{on} the head of them * that compass me a\textbf{bout}.
	
	Let hot burning coals \textbf{fall} upon them * let them be cast into the fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up a\textbf{gain}.
	
	A man full of words shall not pros\textbf{per} upon the earth * evil shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow \textbf{him}.
	
	Sure I am that the Lord \textbf{will} avenge the poor * and maintain the cause of the help\textbf{less}.
	
	The righteous also shall give \textbf{thanks} unto thy Name * and the just shall continue in thy \textbf{sight}.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spi\textbf{rit}.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world without end. A\textbf{men}.
