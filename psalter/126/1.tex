	Except the Lord keep the \textbf{ci}ty * the watchman \textbf{wak}eth but in vain.
	
	It is but lost labor that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of care\textbf{ful}ness * for so he giveth \textbf{his} beloved sleep.
	
	Lo, children and the fruit of \textbf{the} womb * are the heritage and gift that \textbf{com}eth of the Lord.
	
	Like as arrows in the hand of the \textbf{gi}ant * even so are \textbf{the} young children.
	
	Happy is the man who hath his quiver full \textbf{of} them * they shall not be ashamed when they speak with their en\textbf{e}mies in the gate.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
