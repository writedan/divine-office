	Except the Lord keep the \textbf{ci}ty * the watchman \textbf{wa}keth but in vain.

	It is but lost labor that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of \textbf{care}fulness * for so he giveth \textbf{his} beloved sleep.
	
	Lo, children and the fruit \textbf{of} the womb * are the heritage and gift that \textbf{com}eth of the Lord.
	
	Like as arrows in the hand of the \textbf{gi}ant * even so are \textbf{the} young children.
	
	Happy is the man that hath his quiver \textbf{full} of them * they shall not be ashamed when they speak with their en\textbf{e}mies in the gate.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
