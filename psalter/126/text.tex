Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up * may Israel now say.

Except the Lord keep the city * the watchman waketh but in vain.

It is but lost labor that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness * for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

Lo, children and the fruit of the womb * are the heritage and gift that cometh of the Lord.

Like as arrows in the hand of the giant * even so are the young children.

Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them * they shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.

As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
