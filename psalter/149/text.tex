O sing unto the Lord a new song * let the congregation of saints praise him.

Let Israel rejoice in him that made him * and let the children of Zion be joyful in their king.

Let them praise his Name in the dance * let them sing praises unto him with tabret and harp.

For the Lord hath pleasure in his people * and helpeth the meek-hearted.

Let the saints be joyful with glory * let them rejoice in their beds.

Let the praise of God be in their mouth * and a two-edged sword in their hands.

To be avenged of the heathen * and to rebuke the people.

That they may be avenged of them as it is written * Such honor have all his saints.
