	Let Israel rejoice in him that \textbf{made} him * and let the children of Zion be \textbf{joy}ful in their king.
	
	Let them praise his Name in \textbf{the} dance * let them sing praises unto him with \textbf{ta}bret and harp.
	
	For the Lord hath pleasure in his \textbf{peo}ple * and helpeth \textbf{the} meek-hearted.
	
	Let the saints be joyful with \textbf{glor}y * let them \textbf{re}joice in their beds.
	
	Let the praise of God be in \textbf{their} mouth * and a two-\textbf{edged} sword in their hands.
	
	To be avenged of the \textbf{hea}then * and to re\textbf{buke} the people.
	
	That they may be avenged of them as it is \textbf{writ}ten * Such ho\textbf{nor} have all his saints.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
