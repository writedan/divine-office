Preserve me, O God * for in thee have I put my trust.

O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord * Thou art my God, my goods are nothing unto thee.

All my delight is upon the saints who are in the earth * and upon such as excel in virtue.

But they who run after another god * shall have great trouble.

The drink-offerings of blood will I not offer * neither make mention of their names within my lips.

The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup * and he shall restore my inheritance unto me.

The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground * yea, I have a goodly heritage.

I will thank the Lord for giving me warning * my reins also chasten me in the night season.

I have set God always before me * for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not fall.

Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoice * my flesh also shall rest in hope.

For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell * neither shall thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.

Thou shall shew me the path of life, in thy presence is the fullness of joy * and at thy right hand there is pleasure forevermore.
