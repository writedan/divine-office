Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem * praise thy God, O Zion.

For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates * and hath blest thy children within thee.
	
He maketh peace in thy borders * and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
	
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth * and his word runneth very swiftly.
	
He giveth snow like wool * and scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
	
He casteth forth his ice like morsels * who is able to abide his frost?
	
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them * he bloweth his wind, and the waters flow.
	
He sheweth his word unto Jacob * his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
	
He hath not dealt so with any nation * neither have the heathen knowledge of his laws.
	
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.
	
As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
