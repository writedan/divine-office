	For he hath made fast \textbf{the} bars of thy gates * and hath blest thy children with\textbf{in} thee.
	
	He maketh peace \textbf{in} thy borders * and filleth thee with the flour \textbf{of} wheat.
	
	He sendeth forth his command\textbf{ment} upon earth * and his word runneth very \textbf{swift}ly.
	
	He \textbf{giv}eth snow like wool * and scattereth the hoarfrost like \textbf{ash}es.
	
	He casteth forth his \textbf{ice} like morsels * who is able to abide \textbf{his} frost?
	
	He sendeth out his \textbf{word}, and melteth them * he bloweth his wind, and the wat\textbf{ers} flow.
	
	He sheweth his word \textbf{un}to Jacob * his statutes and ordinances unto Is\textbf{ra}el.
	
	He hath not dealt so with \textbf{an}y nation * neither have the heathen knowledge of \textbf{his} laws.
	
	Glory be to the Fath\textbf{er}, and to the Son * and to the Holy \textbf{Spir}it.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world without end. \textbf{A}men.
