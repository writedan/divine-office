	For he hath made fast the bars \textbf{of} thy gates * and hath blest thy chil\textbf{dren} within thee.
	
	He maketh peace in thy \textbf{bor}ders * and filleth thee with the \textbf{flo}ur of wheat.
	
	He sendeth forth his commandment u\textbf{pon} earth * and his word runneth \textbf{ve}ry swiftly.
	
	He giveth \textbf{snow} like wool * and scattereth the hoar\textbf{frost} like ashes.
	
	He casteth forth his ice like \textbf{mor}sels * who is able \textbf{to} abide his frost?
	
	He sendeth out his word, and \textbf{melt}eth them * he bloweth his wind, \textbf{and} the waters flow.
	
	He sheweth his word unto \textbf{Ja}cob * his statutes and ordinances \textbf{un}to Israel.
	
	He hath not dealt so with any \textbf{na}tion * neither have the heathen \textbf{know}ledge of his laws.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
