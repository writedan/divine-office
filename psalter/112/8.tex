	Blessed be the Name \textbf{of} the Lord * from this time \textbf{forth} forevermore.
	
	The Lord's \textbf{Name} is praised * from the rising up of the sun unto the go\textbf{ing} down of the same.
	
	The Lord is high above all \textbf{hea}then * and his glory a\textbf{bove} the heavens.
	
	Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling \textbf{so} high? * and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in \textbf{hea}ven and earth?
	
	He taketh up the simple out \textbf{of} the dust * and lifteth the poor out \textbf{of} the mire.
	
	That he may sit him with the \textbf{prin}ces * even with the princes \textbf{of} his people.
	
	He maketh the barren woman to \textbf{keep} house * and to be the joyful mo\textbf{ther} of children.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
