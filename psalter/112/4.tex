	Blessed be \textbf{the} Name of the Lord * from this \textbf{time} forth forevermore.
	
	The \textbf{Lord's} Name is praised * from the rising up of the sun unto the \textbf{go}ing down of the same.
	
	The Lord is high a\textbf{bove} all heathen * and his glory \textbf{a}bove the heavens.
	
	Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his \textbf{dwel}ling so high? * and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are \textbf{in} heaven and earth?
	
	He taketh up the sim\textbf{ple} out of the dust * and lifteth the poor \textbf{out} of the mire.
	
	That he may sit him \textbf{with} the princes * even with the prin\textbf{ces} of his people.
	
	He maketh the barren \textbf{wo}man to keep house * and to be the joyful \textbf{mo}ther of children.
	
	Glory be to the Fath\textbf{er}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
