	They had swallowed us \textbf{up} quick * when they were so wrathful\textbf{ly} displeased at us.
	
	Truly, the waters had \textbf{drowned} us * and the stream had gove \textbf{o}ver our soul.
	
	The deep waters of \textbf{the} proud * had gone even \textbf{o}ver our soul.
	
	But praised be \textbf{the} Lord * who hath not given us over for a \textbf{prey} unto their teeth.
	
	Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the \textbf{fow}ler * the snare is broken, and we \textbf{are} delivered.
	
	Our help standeth in the Name of \textbf{the} Lord * who hath made \textbf{hea}ven and earth.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
