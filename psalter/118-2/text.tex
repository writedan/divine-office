O do well unto thy servant * that I may live and keep thy word.

Open thou mine eyes * that I may see the wondrous things of thy law.

I am a stranger upon earth * O hide not thy commandments from me.

My soul breaketh out for the very fervent desire * that it hath always unto thy judgments.

Thou hast rebuked the proud * and cursed are they who do err from thy commandments.

O turn from me shame and rebuke * for I have kept thy testimonies.

Princes also did sit and speak against me * but thy servant is occupied in thy statutes.

For thy testimonies are my delight * and my counselors.

My soul cleaveth to the dust * O quicken thou me, according to thy word.

I have acknowledged my ways, and thou heardest me * O teach me thy statutes.

Make me to understand the way of thy commandments * and so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.

My soul melteth away for very heaviness * comfort thou me according to thy word.

Take from me the way of lying * and cause thou me to make much of thy law.

I have chosen the way of truth * and thy judgments have I laid before me.

I have stuck unto thy testimonies * O Lord, confound me not.

I will run the way of thy commandments * when thou hast set my heart at liberty.
