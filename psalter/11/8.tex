	They talk of vanity every one with his \textbf{neigh}bor * they do but flatter with their lips, and speak deceit \textbf{in} their double heart.
	
	The Lord shall root out all de\textbf{ceit}ful lips * and the tongue that \textbf{speak}eth proud things.
	
	Who have said, With our tongue we \textbf{will} prevail * we are they who ought to speak, who \textbf{is} Lord over us?
	
	Now for the comfortless troubles' sake of the \textbf{need}y * and because of the deep \textbf{sigh}ing of the poor.
	
	I will arise, \textbf{saith} the Lord * and will help every one from him who swelleth against him, and \textbf{will} set him at rest.
	
	The words of the Lord are \textbf{pure} words * even as the silver, which from the earth is tried, and purified seven times \textbf{in} the fire.
	
	Thou shalt keep \textbf{them}, O Lord * thou shalt preserve him from this genera\textbf{tion} forever.
	
	The ungodly walk on \textbf{ev}ery side * when they are exalted, the children of men \textbf{are} put to rebuke.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
