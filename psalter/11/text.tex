Help me, O Lord, for a godly man there is no more * for truth is diminished from the sons of men.

They talk of vanity every one with his neighbor * they do but flatter with their lips, and speak deceit in their double heart.

The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips * and the tongue that speaketh proud things.

Who have said, With our tongue we will prevail * we are they who ought to speak, who is Lord over us?

Now for the comfortless troubles' sake of the needy * and because of the deep sighing of the poor.

I will arise, saith the Lord * and will help every one from him who swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.

The words of the Lord are pure words * even as the silver, which from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.

Thou shalt keep them, O Lord * thou shalt preserve him from this generation forever.

The ungodly walk on every side * when they are exalted, the children of men are put to rebuke.
