Blessed is he who considereth the poor and needy * the Lord shall deliver him in the time of trouble.

The Lord preserve him, and give him life, that he may be blessed upon earth * and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.

The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed * make thou restore him from his bed of sickness.

I said, Lord, be merciful unto me * heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.

Mine enemies speak evil of me * When shall he die, and his name perish?

And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity * and his heart conceiveth falsehood within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.

All mine enemies whisper together against me * even against me do they imagine this evil.

Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him * and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.

Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted * who did also eat of my bread, hath laid great wait for me.

But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord * raise thou me up again, and I shall reward them.

By this I know thou favorest me * that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.

Thou hast upheld me because of my innocence * and thou shalt set me before thy face forever.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel * world without end. Amen.
