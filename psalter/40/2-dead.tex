	The Lord preserve him, and give him life, that he may be blessed u\textbf{pon} earth * and deliver not thou him into the will of \textbf{his} enemies.
	
	The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick u\textbf{pon} his bed * make thou restore him from his bed \textbf{of} sickness.
	
	I said, Lord, be merciful \textbf{un}to me * heal my soul, for I have sinned \textbf{a}gainst thee.
	
	Mine enemies speak evil \textbf{of} me * When shall he die, and his \textbf{name} perish?
	
	And if he come to see me, he speaketh \textbf{va}nity * and his heart conceiveth falsehood within himself, and when he cometh forth \textbf{he} telleth it.
	
	All mine enemies whisper together a\textbf{gainst} me * even against me do they imagine \textbf{this} evil.
	
	Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed a\textbf{gainst} him * and now that he lieth, he shall \textbf{rise} up no more.
	
	Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I \textbf{trust}ed * who did also eat of my bread, hath laid \textbf{great} wait for me.
	
	But be thou merciful unto \textbf{me}, O Lord * raise thou me up again, and I shall \textbf{re}ward them.
	
	By this I know thou favor\textbf{est} me * that mine enemy doth not triumph \textbf{a}gainst me.
	
	Thou hast upheld me because of my \textbf{in}nocence * and thou shalt set me before thy face \textbf{for}ever.
	
	Blessed be the Lord God of \textbf{Is}rael * world without \textbf{end}. Amen.
