#title "Alleluia"

Praise ye God in His saints * praise Him in the firmament of His power.

Praise Him for His mighty acts * praise Him according to the multitude of His greatness.

Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet * praise Him with the psaltery and harp.

Praise Him with the timbrel and the dance * praise Him with strings and flute.

Praise Him with tuneful cymbals * praise Him with cymbals of jubilitation.

Let every breath praise the Lord * praise ye the Lord.
