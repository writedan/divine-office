God be merciful unto us, and bless us * and shew us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto us.

That thy way may be known upon earth * thy salvation among all nations.

Let the peoples praise thee, O God * yea, let all the peoples praise thee.

O let the nations rejoice and be glad * for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.

Then shall the earth bring forth her increase * and God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing.

God shall bless us * and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
