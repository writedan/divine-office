	My help cometh even \textbf{from} the Lord * who hath made hea\textbf{ven} and earth.
	
	He will not suffer thy foot \textbf{to} be moved * and he that keepeth \textbf{thee} will not sleep.
	
	Behold, he that keepeth \textbf{Is}rael * shall neither slum\textbf{ber} nor sleep.
	
	The Lord himself is thy \textbf{keep}er * the Lord is thy defense upon \textbf{thy} right hand.
	
	So that the sun shall not burn \textbf{thee} by day * neither \textbf{the} moon by night.
	
	The Lord shall preserve thee from all \textbf{ev}il * truly, it is even he that \textbf{shall} keep thy soul.
	
	The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy \textbf{com}ing in * from this time forth \textbf{for}evermore.
