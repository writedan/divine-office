	My help cometh even \textbf{from} the Lord * who hath made \textbf{hea}ven and earth.
	
	He will not suffer thy foot \textbf{to} be moved * and he who keep\textbf{eth} thee will not sleep.
	
	Behold, he who keepeth \textbf{Is}rael * shall neither \textbf{slum}ber nor sleep.
	
	The Lord himself is thy \textbf{keep}er * the Lord is thy defense up\textbf{on} thy right hand.
	
	So that the sun shall not burn \textbf{thee} by day * nei\textbf{ther} the moon by night.
	
	The Lord shall preserve thee from all \textbf{e}vil * truly, it is even he \textbf{who} shall keep thy soul.
	
	The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy \textbf{com}ing in * from this time \textbf{forth} forevermore.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
