In thee, O Lord, have I put my trust * let me never be put to confusion, deliver me in thy righteousness.

Bow down thine ear to me * make haste to deliver me.

And be thou my strong rock, and house of defense * that thou mayest save me.

For thou art my strong rock, and my castle * be thou also my guide, and lead me for thy Name's sake.

Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me * for thou art my strength.

Into thy hands I commend my spirit * for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of truth.

I have hated them who hold of lying vanities * and my trust hath been in the Lord.

I will be glad, and rejoice in thy mercy * for thou hast considered my trouble, and hast known my soul in adversities.

Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy * but hast set my feet in a large room.

Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble * and mine eye is consumed for very heaviness, yea my soul and my body.
