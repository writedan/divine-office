	The hills stand about Je\textbf{ru}salem * even so standeth the Lord round about his people, from this time \textbf{forth} forevermore.
	
	For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the \textbf{right}eous * lest the righteous put their hand \textbf{un}to wickedness.
	
	Do well, \textbf{O} Lord * unto those who are \textbf{good} and true of heart.
	
	As for such as turn back unto their own \textbf{wick}edness * the Lord shall lead them forth with the evildoers; but peace shall be \textbf{up}on Israel.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
