	\textbf{Hear} my prayer, O God * and hearken unto \textbf{the} words of my mouth.
	
	For strangers are risen \textbf{up} against me * and tyrants, who have not God before their eyes, \textbf{seek} after my soul.
	
	Behold, God \textbf{is} my helper * the Lord is with \textbf{them} who uphold my soul.
	
	He shall reward evil un\textbf{to} mine enemies * des\textbf{troy} thou them in thy truth.
	
	An offering of a free heart \textbf{will} I give thee * and I will praise thy Name, O Lord, \textbf{be}cause it is good.
	
	For he hath delivered me out of \textbf{all} my trouble * and mine eyes hath seen his desire \textbf{up}on mine enemies.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
