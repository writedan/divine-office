Save me, O God, for thy Name's sake * and avenge me in thy strength.

Hear my prayer, O God * and hearken unto the words of my mouth.

For strangers are risen up against me * and tyrants, who have not God before their eyes, seek after my soul.

Behold, God is my helper * the Lord is with them who uphold my soul.

He shall reward evil unto mine enemies * destroy thou them in thy truth.

An offering of a free heart will I give thee * and I will praise thy Name, O Lord, because it is good.

For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble * and mine eyes hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
