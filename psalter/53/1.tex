	Hear my prayer, \textbf{O} God * and hearken unto \textbf{the} words of my mouth.
	
	For strangers are risen up a\textbf{gainst} me * and tyrants, which have not God before their eyes, \textbf{seek} after my soul.
	
	Behold, God is my \textbf{hel}per * the Lord is with them \textbf{that} uphold my soul.
	
	He shall reward evil unto mine e\textbf{ne}mies * destroy thou \textbf{them} in thy truth.
	
	An offering of a free heart will I \textbf{give} thee * and I will praise thy Name, O Lord, \textbf{be}cause it is good.
	
	For he hath delivered me out of all my \textbf{trou}ble * and mine eyes hath seen his desire u\textbf{pon} mine enemies.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
