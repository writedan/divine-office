I believed, and therefore will I speak, but I was sore troubled * I said in my haste, All men are liars.

What reward shall I give unto the Lord * for all the benefits he hath done unto me?

I will receive the cup of salvation * and call upon the Name of the Lord.

I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people * right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.

Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant * I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaiden, thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.

I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving * and will call upon the Name of the Lord.

I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the sight of all his people * in the courts of the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
