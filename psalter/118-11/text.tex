Princes have persecuted me without a cause * but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.

I am as glad of thy word * as one who findeth great spoils.

As for lies, I hate and abhor them * but thy law do I love.

Seven times a day do I praise thee * because of thy righteous judgments.

Great is the peace that they have who love thy law * and they are not offended at it.

Lord, I have looked for thy salvation * and done after thy commandments.

My soul hath kept thy testimonies * and loved them exceedingly.

I have kept thy commandments and testimonies * for all my ways are before thee.

Let my complaint come before thee, O Lord * give me understanding according to thy word.

Let my supplication come before thee * deliver me according to thy word.

My lips shall speak of thy praise * when thou hast taught me thy statutes.

Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word * for all thy commandments are righteous.

Let thine hand help me * for I have chosen thy commandments.

I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord * and in thy law is my delight.

O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee * and thy judgments shall help me.

I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost * O seek thy servant, for I do not forget thy commandments.
