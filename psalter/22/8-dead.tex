	He maketh me to lie down in green \textbf{pas}tures * he leadeth me beside \textbf{the} still waters.
	
	He restoreth \textbf{my} soul * he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness \textbf{for} his Name's sake.
	
	Yea, thought I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no \textbf{ev}il * for thou art with me, thy rod and thy \textbf{staff} shall comfort me.
	
	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine \textbf{en}emies * thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup \textbf{run}neth over.
	
	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days \textbf{of} my life * and I will dwell in the house of the \textbf{Lord} forever.
