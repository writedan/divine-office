	He shall feed me in \textbf{a} green pasture * and lead me forth beside the \textbf{wat}ers of comfort.
	
	He \textbf{shall} convert my soul * and bring me forth in the paths of righteous\textbf{ness} for his Name's sake.
	
	Yea, thought I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will \textbf{fear} no evil * for thou art with me, thy rod \textbf{and} thy staff comfort me.
	
	Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of \textbf{them} that trouble me * thou hast anointed my head with oil \textbf{and} my cup shall be full.
	
	But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the \textbf{days} of my life * and I will dwell in the house of \textbf{the} Lord forever.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
