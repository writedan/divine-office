	He maketh me to lie down \textbf{in} green pastures * he leadeth me be\textbf{side} the still waters.
	
	He re\textbf{stor}eth my soul * he leadeth me in the paths of righteous\textbf{ness} for his Name's sake.
	
	Yea, thought I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will \textbf{fear} no evil * for thou art with me, thy rod and \textbf{thy} staff shall comfort me.
	
	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence \textbf{of} mine enemies * thou hast anointed my head with oil; my \textbf{cup} runneth over.
	
	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all \textbf{the} days of my life * and I will dwell in the house of \textbf{the} Lord forever.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
