The Lord is my shepherd * therefore can I lack nothing.

He shall feed me in a green pasture * and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort.

He shall convert my soul * and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness for his Name's sake.

Yea, thought I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil * for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that trouble me * thou hast anointed my head with oil and my cup shall be full.

But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life * and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
