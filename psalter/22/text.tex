The Lord is my shepherd * therefore I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures * he leadeth me beside the still waters.

He restoreth my soul * he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his Name's sake.

Yea, thought I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil * for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies * thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life * and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
