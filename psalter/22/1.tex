	He maketh me to lie down in green \textbf{pas}tures * he leadeth me beside \textbf{the} still waters.
	
	He restoreth \textbf{my} soul * he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness \textbf{for} his Name's sake.
	
	Yea, thought I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no \textbf{ev}il * for thou art with me, thy rod and thy \textbf{staff} shall comfort me.
	
	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine en\textbf{e}mies * thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup \textbf{run}neth over.
	
	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of \textbf{my} life * and I will dwell in the house of the \textbf{Lord} forever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
