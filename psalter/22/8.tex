	He shall feed me in a green \textbf{pas}ture * and lead me forth beside the wat\textbf{ers} of comfort.
	
	He shall con\textbf{vert} my soul * and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness \textbf{for} his Name's sake.
	
	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no \textbf{ev}il * for thou art with me, thy rod and \textbf{thy} staff comfort me.
	
	Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of them that \textbf{trou}ble me * thou hast anointed my head with oil and \textbf{my} cup shall be full.
	
	But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days \textbf{of} my life * and I will dwell in the house of the \textbf{Lord} forever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
