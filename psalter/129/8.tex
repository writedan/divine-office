	O let thine ears con\textbf{si}der well * the voice \textbf{of} my complaint.
	
	If thou, Lord, wilt mark i\textbf{ni}quities * O Lord, who \textbf{may} abide it?
	
	For with thee there is \textbf{mer}cy  * and there\textbf{fore} shalt thou be feared.
	
	I look for the Lord; my soul doth \textbf{wait} for him * in \textbf{his} word is my trust.
	
	My soul fleeth un\textbf{to} the Lord * before the morning watch, I say, be\textbf{fore} the morning watch.
	
	O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is \textbf{mer}cy * and with him is plen\textbf{teous} redemption.
	
	And he shall redeem \textbf{Is}rael * from all \textbf{his} iniquities.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
