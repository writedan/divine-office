Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord * O Lord, hear my voice.

O let thine ears consider well * the voice of my complaint.
	
If thou, Lord, wilt mark iniquities * O Lord, who may abide it?
	
For with thee there is mercy  * and therefore shalt thou be feared.
	
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him * in his word is my trust.
	
My soul fleeth unto the Lord * before the morning watch, I say, before the morning watch.
	
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy * and with him is plenteous redemption.
	
And he shall redeem Israel * from all his iniquities.
	
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.
	
As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
