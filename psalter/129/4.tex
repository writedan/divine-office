	O let thine \textbf{ears} consider well * \textbf{the} voice of my complaint.
	
	If thou, Lord, wilt \textbf{mark} iniquities * O Lord, \textbf{who} may abide it?
	
	For there is \textbf{mer}cy with thee * and \textbf{there}fore shalt thou be feared.
	
	I look for the Lord; my \textbf{soul} doth wait for him * \textbf{in} his word is my trust.
	
	My soul fle\textbf{eth} unto the Lord * before the morning watch, I say, \textbf{be}fore the morning watch.
	
	O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord \textbf{there} is mercy * and with him is plen\textbf{te}ous redemption.
	
	And he shall \textbf{re}deem Israel * from \textbf{all} his iniquities.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
