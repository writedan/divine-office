	O let thine \textbf{ears} consider well * the voice of \textbf{my} complaint.
	
	If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark \textbf{what} is done amiss * O Lord, who may a\textbf{bide} it?
	
	For there is \textbf{mer}cy with thee * and therefore shalt \textbf{thou} be feared.
	
	I look for the Lord; my \textbf{soul} doth wait for him * in his word \textbf{is} my trust.
	
	My soul fle\textbf{eth} unto the Lord * before the morning watch, I say, before the \textbf{morn}ing watch.
	
	O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord \textbf{there} is mercy * and with him is plenteous re\textbf{demp}tion.
	
	And he shall \textbf{re}deem Israel * from \textbf{all} his sins.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to the Holy \textbf{Spir}it.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world without end. \textbf{A}men.
