In the Lord I put my trust * how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a bird unto the hill?

For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the quiver * that they may privily shoot at them who are true of heart.

For the foundations will be cast down * and what hath the righteous done?

The Lord is in his holy temple * the Lord's seat is in heaven.

His eyes consider the poor * and his eyelids try the children of men.

The Lord examineth the righteous and the ungodly * but he who delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor him.

Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone * storm and tempest shall be their portion to drink.

For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness * his countenance will behold justice.
