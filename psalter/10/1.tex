	For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the \textbf{qui}ver * that they may privily shoot at them \textbf{who} are true of heart.
	
	For the foundations will be \textbf{cast} down * and what \textbf{hath} the righteous done?
	
	The Lord is in his holy \textbf{tem}ple * the Lord's seat \textbf{is} in heaven.
	
	His eyes consider \textbf{the} poor * and his eyelids try the \textbf{child}ren of men.
	
	The Lord examineth the righteous and the un\textbf{god}ly * but he who delighteth in wickedness, doth his \textbf{soul} abhor him.
	
	Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire, and \textbf{brim}stone * storm and tempest shall be their \textbf{por}tion to drink.
	
	For the righteous Lord loveth righ\textbf{teous}ness * his countenance will \textbf{be}hold justice.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
