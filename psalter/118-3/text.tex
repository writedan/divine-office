Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes * and I shall keep it unto the end.

Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law * yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart.

Make me to go in the path of thy commandments * for therein is my desire.

Incline my heart unto thy testimonies * and not to covetousness.

O turn away mine eyes, lest they behold vanity * and quicken thou me in thy way.

O establish thy word in thy servant * that I may fear thee.

Take away the rebuke that I am afraid of * for thy judgments are good.

Behold, my delight is in thy commandments * O quicken thou me in thy righteousness.

Let thy loving mercy come also unto me, O Lord * even thy salvation, according unto thy word.

So shall I make answer unto my blasphemers * for my trust is in thy word.

O take not the word of thy truth utterly out of my mouth * for my hope is in thy judgments.

So shall I always keep thy law * yea, forever and ever.

And I will walk at liberty * for I seek thy commandments.

I will speak of thy testimonies also, even before kings * and will not be ashamed.

And my delight shall be in thy commandments * because which I have loved.

My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved * and my study shall be in thy statues.
