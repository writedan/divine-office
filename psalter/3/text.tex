Lord, how multiplied are they who trouble me * many are they who rise against me.

Many a one there be who say of my soul * There is no help for him from his God.

But thou, O Lord, art my defender * thou art my glory, and the lifter of my head.

I did call upon the Lord with my voice * and he heard me out of his holy mountain.

I laid me down and slept, and rose up again * for the Lord hath sustained me.

I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people * who have set themselves against me round about.

Arise, O Lord, and help me, O my God * for thou smitest all mine enemies and broken the teeth of the ungodly.

Salvation belongeth unto the Lord * and thy blessing is upon thy people.
