	Many a one there be who \textbf{say} of \textbf{my} soul * There is no help for \textbf{him} from his God.
	
	But thou, O Lord, art \textbf{my} de\textbf{fend}er * thou art my glory, and the lift\textbf{er} of my head.
	
	I did call upon the \textbf{Lord} with \textbf{my} voice * and he heard me out of his ho\textbf{ly} mountain.

	I will not be afraid for ten thousands \textbf{of} the \textbf{peo}ple * who have set themselves against \textbf{me} round about.
	
	Arise, O Lord, and \textbf{help} me, \textbf{O} my God * for thou smitest all mine enemies and broken the teeth of the \textbf{un}godly.
	
	Salvation belongeth \textbf{un}to \textbf{the} Lord * and thy blessing is upon \textbf{thy} people.
	
	Glory be to the \textbf{Fa}ther, and \textbf{t}o the Son * and to the Ho\textbf{ly} Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er \textbf{shall} be * world without \textbf{end}. Amen.
