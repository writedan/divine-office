	Have mercy upon me, O \textbf{Lord}, for \textbf{I }am weak * O Lord, heal me, for \textbf{my} bones are vexed.
	
	My soul also is sore \textbf{trou}bled * O Lord, how long wilt \textbf{thou} punish me?
	
	Turn thee, O Lord, and de\textbf{li}ver \textbf{my} soul * O save me for \textbf{thy} mercy's sake.
	
	For in death no man re\textbf{mem}ber\textbf{eth} thee * and who will give thee \textbf{thanks} in the pit?
	
	I am weary \textbf{of} my \textbf{groan}ing * every night I wash my bed and water my \textbf{couch} with my tears.
	
	Mine eye is con\textbf{sumed} be\textbf{cause} of grief * I have grown old amongst all \textbf{mine} enemies.
	
	Away from me, all ye who \textbf{work} in\textbf{i}quity * for the Lord hath heard the voice of \textbf{my} weeping.
	
	The Lord hath heard \textbf{my} pe\textbf{ti}tion * the Lord will \textbf{re}ceive my prayer.
	
	All mine enemies shall be con\textbf{found}ed and \textbf{sore} vexed * they shall be turned back, and put to \textbf{shame} suddenly.
	
	Glory be to the \textbf{Fa}ther, and \textbf{t}o the Son * and to the Ho\textbf{ly} Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er \textbf{shall} be * world without \textbf{end}. Amen.
