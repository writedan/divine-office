O Lord, rebuke me not in thine indignation * neither chastise me in thy displeasure.

Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak * O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed.

My soul also is sore troubled * O Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?

Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul * O save me for thy mercy's sake.

For in death no man remembereth thee * and who will give thee thanks in the pit?

I am weary of my groaning * every night wash I my bed and water my couch with my tears.

Mine eye is consumed because of grief * I have grown old amongst all mine enemies.

Away from me, all ye who work iniquity * for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.

The Lord hath heard my petition * the Lord will receive my prayer.

All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed * they shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.
