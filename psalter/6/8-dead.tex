	Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for \textbf{I} am weak * O Lord, heal me, \textbf{for} my bones are vexed.
	
	My soul also is sore \textbf{trou}bled * O Lord, how long \textbf{wilt} thou punish me?
	
	Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver \textbf{my} soul * O save me \textbf{for} thy mercy's sake.
	
	For in death no man remem\textbf{ber}eth thee * and who will give \textbf{thee} thanks in the pit?
	
	I am weary of my \textbf{groa}ning * every night I wash my bed and water \textbf{my} couch with my tears.
	
	Mine eye is consumed be\textbf{cause} of grief * I have grown old amongst \textbf{all} mine enemies.
	
	Away from me, all ye who work in\textbf{i}quity * for the Lord hath heard the voice \textbf{of} my weeping.
	
	The Lord hath heard my pe\textbf{ti}tion * the Lord \textbf{will} receive my prayer.
	
	All mine enemies shall be confounded and \textbf{sore} vexed * they shall be turned back, and put \textbf{to} shame suddenly.
