Ponder my words, O Lord * consider my meditation.

O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God * for unto thee will I make my prayer.

My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord * early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness * neither shall any evil dwell with thee.

Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight * for thou hatest all them that work vanity.

Thou shalt destroy them that speak lying * the Lord will abhor both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.

But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy mercy * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies * make thy way plain before my face.

For there is no faithfulness in his mouth * their inward parts are very wickedness.

Their throat is an open sepulcher * they flatter with their tongue.

Destroy thou them, O God, let them perish through their own imaginations * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness, for they have rebelled against thee.

And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice * they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them, they that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee.

For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous * and with thy favorable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
