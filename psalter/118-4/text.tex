O think upon thy servant, as concerning thy word * wherein thou hast caused me to put my trust.

The same is my comfort in my trouble * for thy word hath quickened me.

The proud have had me exceedingly in derision * yet have I not shrinked from thy law.

For I remembered thine everlasting judgments, O Lord * and received comfort.

I am horribly afraid * for the ungodly that forsake thy law.

Thy statutes have been my songs * in the house of my pilgrimage.

I have thought upon thy Name, O Lord, in the night season * and have kept thy law.

This has become mine * because I kept thy commandments.

Thou art my portion, O Lord * I have promised to keep thy law.

I made my humble petition in thy presence with my whole heart * O be merciful unto me, according to thy word.

I called mine own ways to remembrance * and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

I made haste, and prolonged not the time * to keep thy commandments.

The congregation of the ungodly have robbed me * but I have not forgotten thy law.

At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee * because of thy righteous judgments.

I am a companion of all them that fear thee * and keep thy commandments.

The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy * O teach me thy statutes.
