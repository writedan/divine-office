Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way * and walk in the law of the Lord.

Blessed are they that keep his testimonies * and seek him with their whole heart.

For they who do no wickedness * who walk in his eyes.

Thou hast charged us * that we shall diligently keep thy commandments.

O that my ways were made so direct * that I might keep thy statutes.

So shall I not be confounded * while I have respect unto all thy commandments.

I will thank thee with an unfeigned heart * when I shall have learned the judgments of thy righteousness.

I will keep thy ceremonies * O forsake me not utterly.

Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way * even by ruling himself after thy word.

With my whole heart have I sought thee * O let me not go wrong out of thy commandments.

Thy words have I hid within my heart * that I should not sin against thee.

Blessed art thou, O Lord * O teach me thy statutes.

With my lips have I been telling * of all the judgments of thy mouth.

I have had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies * as in all manner of riches.

I will talk of thy commandments * and have respect unto thy ways.

My delight shall be in thy statutes * and I will not forget thy word.
