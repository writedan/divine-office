The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble * the Name of the God of Jacob defend thee.

Send thee help from the sanctuary * and strengthen thee out of Zion.

Remember all thy offerings * and accept thy burnt sacrifice.

Grant thee thy heart's desire * and fulfill all thy mind.

We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God * the Lord perform all thy petitions.

Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy heaven * even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.

Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses * but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God.

They are brought down, and fallen * but we are risen, and stand upright.

Save us, O Lord, and hear us, O King of heaven * when we call upon thee.
