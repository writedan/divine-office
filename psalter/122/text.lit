#title "An Ode of Ascents"

Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes * unto Thee who dwellest in heaven.

Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters + as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her mistress * so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until He take pity on us.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us * for greatly we are filled with abasement.

Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith * let reproach come upon them who prosper, and abasement on the proud.
