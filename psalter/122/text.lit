#title "An Ode of Ascents"

Unto You have I lifted u my eyes, * unto You Who dwells in heaven.

Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters, + and as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her mistress, * so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until He have mercy upon us.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, * for we are greatly filled with contempt.

Greatly has our soul been filled with the reproach of them who prosper, * and with the contempt of the proud.
