	Behold, even as the eyes of \textbf{ser}vants * look unto the hand \textbf{of} their masters.
	
	And as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her \textbf{mis}tress * even so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until he have mer\textbf{cy} upon us.
	
	Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy up\textbf{on} us * for we are ut\textbf{ter}ly despised.
	
	Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the \textbf{weal}thy * and with the despite\textbf{ful}ness of the proud.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
