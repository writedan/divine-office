	I poured out my complaints be\textbf{fore} him * and shewed him \textbf{of} my trouble.
	
	When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest \textbf{my} path * in the way wherein I walked have they privily \textbf{laid} a snare for me.
	
	I looked also upon my \textbf{right} hand * and saw there was no man \textbf{that} would know me.
	
	I had no place to \textbf{flee} unto * and no man \textbf{cared} for my soul.
	
	I cried unto thee, O \textbf{Lord}, and said * Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land \textbf{of} the living.
	
	Consider \textbf{my} complaint * for I \textbf{am} brought very low.
	
	O deliver me from my perse\textbf{cu}tors * for they \textbf{are} too strong for me.
	
	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks un\textbf{to} thy Name * which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort un\textbf{to} my company.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
