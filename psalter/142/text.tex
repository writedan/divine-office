Hear my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire * hearken unto me for thy truth and righteousness' sake.

And enter not into judgment with thy servant * for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground * he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long dead.

Therefore is my spirit vexed within me * and my heart within me is desolate.

Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works * yea, I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.

I stretch forth my hands unto thee * my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.

Hear me soon, O Lord, for my spirit waxeth faint * hide not thy face from me, lest I become like unto them that go down into the pit.

O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust * shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul to thee.

Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies * for I flee unto thee to hide me.

Teach me to do that which pleaseth thee, for thou art my God * let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.

Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake * and for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

And of thy goodness slay mine enemies * and destroy all them that vex my soul, for I am thy servant.
