#title "An Ode of Ascents"

°Be°hold now, bless `ye the Lord * all ye ~servants `of the Lord.

Ye who stand in the house `of the Lord * in the courts of ~the house `of our God.

In the night lift up your hands unto the sanctu`ary * ~and bless `ye the Lord.

The Lord bless thee out of `Zion * He Who made ~heaven `and earth.
