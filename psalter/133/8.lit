#title "An Ode of Ascents"

(Be)(hold) now, `bless` the Lord, * all you ~ser~vants `of` the Lord.

You who by night stand in the house `of` the Lord, * in the courts of ~the~ house `of` our God.

In the night lift `up` your hands, * and bless the Lord in the ~san~ctu`a`ry.

The Lord bless you out of `Zi`on, * He Who made ~hea~ven `and` the earth.
