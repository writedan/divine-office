#title "An Ode of Ascents"

Behold now, bless the Lord, * all you servants of the Lord.

You who by night stand in the house of the Lord, * in the courts of the house of our God.

In the night lift up your hands, * and bless the Lord in the sanctuary.

The Lord bless you out of Zion, * He Who made heaven and the earth.
