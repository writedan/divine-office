#title "An Ode of Ascents"

Behold now, bless ye the Lord * all ye servants of the Lord.

Ye who stand in the house of th eLord * in the courts of the house of our God.

In the night lift up your hands unto the sanctuary * and bless the Lord.

The Lord bless thee out of Zion * He Who made heaven and earth.
