	Ye that by night stand in the house \textbf{of} the Lord * even in the courts of the \textbf{house} of our God.
	
	Lift up your hands in the sanctu\textbf{ar}y * \textbf{and} praise the Lord.
	
	The Lord that made heaven \textbf{and} earth * give thee blessing \textbf{out} of Zion.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
