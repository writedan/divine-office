Bring unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord * ascribe unto the Lord worship and strength.

Give the Lord the honor due unto his Name * worship the Lord with holy worship.

It is the Lord who commandeth the waters * it is the glorious God who maketh the thunder.

It is the Lord who ruleth the sea, the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation * the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.

The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar trees * yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

He maketh them also to skip like a calf * Lebanon also, and his beloved like a young unicorn.

The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire, the voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness * yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.

The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the thick bushes * in his temple doth everything speak of his honor.

The Lord sitteth above the water flood * and the Lord remaineth King forevermore.

The Lord shall give strength unto his people * the Lord shall give his people the blessing of peace.
