My soul hath longed for thy salvation * and I have a good hope because of thy word.

Mine eyes long sore for thy word, saying: * O when wilt thou comfort me?

For I am become like a bottle in the smoke * yet do I not forget thy statutes.

How many are the days of thy servant? * when wilt thou be avenged of them who persecute me?

The proud have dug pits for me * which are not after thy law.

All thy commandments are true * they persecute me falsely; O be thou my help.

They had almost made an end of me upon earth * but I forsook not thy commandments.

O quicken me after thy loving-kindness * and so shall I keep the testimonies of thy mouth.

O Lord, thy word endureth * forever in heaven.

Thy truth also remaineth * from one generation to another.

Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth * they continue this day according to thine ordinance, for all things serve thee.

If my delight had not been in thy law * I should have perished in my trouble.

I will never forget thy commandments * for with them thou hast quickened me.

I am thine, O save thou me * for I have sought thy commandments.

The ungodly laid wait for me to destroy me * but I will consider thy testimonies.

I see that all things come to an end * but thy commandment is exceedingly broad.
