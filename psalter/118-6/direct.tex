	My soul hath longed for \textbf{thy} salvation * and I have a good hope because of \textbf{thy} word.
	
	Mine eyes long sore for \textbf{thy} word, saying: * O when wilt thou com\textbf{fort} me?
	
	For I am become like a \textbf{bot}tle in the smoke * yet do I not forget thy stat\textbf{utes}.
	
	How many are the days \textbf{of} thy servant? * when wilt thou be avenged of them who persecute \textbf{me}?
	
	The proud \textbf{have} dug pits for me * which are not after \textbf{thy} law.
	
	All thy com\textbf{mand}ments are true * they persecute me falsely; O be thou \textbf{my} help.
	
	They had almost made an end of \textbf{me} upon earth * but I forsook not thy command\textbf{ments}.
	
	O quicken me after thy \textbf{lov}ing-kindness * and so shall I keep the testimonies of \textbf{thy} mouth.
	
	O Lord, thy \textbf{word} endureth * forever in hea\textbf{ven}.
	
	Thy truth al\textbf{so} remaineth * from one generation to ano\textbf{ther}.
	
	Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth and \textbf{it} abideth * they continue this day according to thine ordinance, for all things serve \textbf{thee}.
	
	If my delight had \textbf{not} been in thy law * I should have perished in my trou\textbf{ble}.
	
	I will never forget \textbf{thy} commandments * for with them thou hast quick\textbf{ened} me.
	
	I am \textbf{thine}, O save thou me * for I have sought thy command\textbf{ments}.
	
	The ungodly laid wait for me \textbf{to} destroy me * but I will consider thy testimon\textbf{ies}.
	
	I see that all \textbf{things} come to an end * but thy commandment is exceedingly \textbf{broad}.
