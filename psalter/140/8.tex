	Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the \textbf{in}cense * and let the lifting up of my hands be an \textbf{even}ing sacrifice.
	
	Set a watch, O Lord, be\textbf{fore} my mouth * and keep \textbf{the} door of my lips.
	
	O let not mine heart be inclined to any \textbf{e}vil thing * let me not be occupied in ungodly works with the men who work wickedness, neither let me eat of such \textbf{things} as please them.
	
	Let the righteous rather smite me \textbf{friend}ly * \textbf{and} reprove me.
	
	But let not their precious balms \textbf{break} my head * yea, I will pray yet a\textbf{gainst} their wickedness.
	
	Let their judges be overthrown in stony \textbf{pla}ces * that they may hear my \textbf{words}, for they are sweet.
	
	Our bones lie scattered be\textbf{fore} the pit * like as when one breaketh and heweth \textbf{wood} upon the earth.
	
	But mine eyes look unto thee, O \textbf{Lord} God * in thee is my trust, O \textbf{cast} not out my soul.
	
	Keep me from the snare that they have \textbf{laid} for me * and from the traps of the \textbf{wick}ed doers.
	
	Let the ungodly fall into their own net to\textbf{ge}ther * and let me ev\textbf{er} escape them.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
