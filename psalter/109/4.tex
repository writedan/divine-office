	The Lord shall send the rod of thy power \textbf{out} of Zion * be thou ruler, even in the midst \textbf{a}mong thine enemies.

	In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with a \textbf{ho}ly worship * the dew of thy birth is of the \textbf{womb} of the morning.
	
	The Lord sware, \textbf{and} will not repent * Thou art a priest forever after the or\textbf{der} of Melchizedek.
	
	The Lord u\textbf{pon} thy right hand * shall wound even kings \textbf{in} the day of his wrath.
	
	He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with \textbf{the} dead bodies * and smite in sunder the heads o\textbf{ver} diverse countries.
	
	He shall drink of \textbf{the} brook in the way * therefore \textbf{shall} he lift up his head.
	
	Glory be to the Fath\textbf{er}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
