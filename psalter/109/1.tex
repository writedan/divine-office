	The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of \textbf{Zi}on * be thou ruler, even in the midst a\textbf{mong} thine enemies.
	
	In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with a holy \textbf{wor}ship * the dew of thy birth is of the womb \textbf{of} the morning.
	
	The Lord sware, and will not \textbf{re}pent: * Thou art a priest forever after the order \textbf{of} Melchizedek.
	
	The Lord upon thy \textbf{right} hand * shall wound even kings in the \textbf{day} of his wrath.
	
	He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead \textbf{bod}ies * and smite in sunder the heads over \textbf{di}verse countries.
	
	He shall drink of the brook in \textbf{the} way * therefore shall \textbf{he} lift up his head.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now and ever \textbf{shall} be: * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
