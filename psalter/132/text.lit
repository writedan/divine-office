#title "An Ode of Ascents"

Behold now, what is so good or so joyous * as for brethren to dwell together in unity?

It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head which runs down upon the bread, * upon the beard of Aaron, whih runs down to the fringe of his garment.

It is like the dew of Hermon, * which comes down upon the mountains of Zion.

For there the Lord commanded his blessing, * and life forevermore.
