	It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down unto \textbf{the} beard * even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts \textbf{of} his clothing.
	
	Like as the dew of \textbf{Her}mon * which fell upon the \textbf{hill} of Zion.
	
	For there the Lord promised his \textbf{bles}sing * and \textbf{life} forevermore.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
