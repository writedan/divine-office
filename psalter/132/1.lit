#title "An Ode of Ascents"

Behold now, what is so good or so `joyous * as for brethren to dwell toge~ther in `unity?

It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head, which runneth down u`pon the heard * upon the beard of Aaron, which runneth down to the fringe ~of his `raiment.

It is like the dew of `Hermon * which cometh down upon the moun~tains of `Zion.

For there the Lord commanded the `blessing * ~life for`evermore.
