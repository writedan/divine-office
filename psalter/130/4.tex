	I do not exercise myself \textbf{in} great matters * which are too high \textbf{for} me.
	
	But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned \textbf{from} his mother * yea, my soul is even as a weaned \textbf{chi}ld.
	
	O Isra\textbf{el}, trust in the Lord * from this time forth fore\textbf{ver}more.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to the Holy \textbf{Spir}it.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world without end. \textbf{A}men.
