	I do not exercise myself \textbf{in} great matters * which are too high for me.
	
	But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned \textbf{from} his mother * yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
	
	O Isra\textbf{el}, trust in the Lord * from this time forth forevermore.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world without end. Amen.
