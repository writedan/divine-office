#title "An Ode of Ascents"

O Lord, my heart is ~not ex`alted * nor are mine eyes become `lofty.

Nor have I ~walked in `things too great * or too marve`lous for me.

If I were not humbled-minded but ~exalt`ed my soul * as one weaned from his mother, so wouldst Thou re`quite my soul.

Let Isra~el hope `in the Lord * from henceforth and for`evermore.
