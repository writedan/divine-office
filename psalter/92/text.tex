The Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel * the Lord hath put on his apparel, and girded himself with strength.

He hath made the round world so sure * that it cannot be moved.

Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared * thou art from everlasting.

The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice * the floods lift up their waves.

The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly * but yet the Lord, who dwelleth on high, is mightier.

Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure * holiness becometh thine house forever.
