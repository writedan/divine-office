	He hath made the \textbf{round} world \textbf{so} sure * that it can\textbf{not} be moved.
	
	Ever since the world began hath thy \textbf{seat} been \textbf{pre}pared * thou art from ev\textbf{er}lasting.
	
	The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have \textbf{lift}ed up \textbf{their} voice * the floods \textbf{lift} up their waves.
	
	The waves of the sea are mighty, \textbf{and} rage hor\textbf{ri}bly * but yet the Lord, who dwelleth on high, \textbf{is} mightier.
	
	Thy testimonies, O \textbf{Lord}, are ve\textbf{ry} sure * holiness becometh thine house \textbf{for}ever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the Ho\textbf{ly} Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
