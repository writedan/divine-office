	He hath made the round world \textbf{so} sure * that it \textbf{can}not be moved.
	
	Ever since the world began hath thy seat been \textbf{pre}pared * thou art from \textbf{ev}erlasting.
	
	The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lifted up \textbf{their} voice * the \textbf{floods} lift up their waves.
	
	The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage hor\textbf{ri}bly * but yet the Lord, who dwelleth on \textbf{high}, is mightier.
	
	Thy testimonies, O Lord, are ve\textbf{ry} sure * holiness becometh thine \textbf{house} forever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen
