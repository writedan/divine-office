Why do the heathen rage together * and the people imagine a vain thing?

The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together * against the Lord, and against his Anointed.

Let us break their bonds asunder * and cast away their cords from us.

He who dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn * the Lord shall have them in derision.

Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath * and vex them in his sore displeasure.

I am appointed King by him over Zion his holy mountain * preaching the commandment of the Lord.

Whereof the Lord hath said unto me * Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

Ask of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance * and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron * and break them in pieces like a potters' vessel.

Be wise now therefore, O ye kings * take counsel, ye who are judges of the earth.

Serve ye the Lord in fear * and rejoice unto him with reverence.

Lay hold of instruction, lest at any time the Lord be angry * and ye perish from the righteous way.

When quickly his wrath be kindled * blessed are all they who have put their trust in him.
