	For thou shalt eat the labors \textbf{of} thine hands * O well is thee, and \textbf{hap}py shalt thou be.
	
	Thy wife shall be as the \textbf{fruit}ful vine * upon \textbf{the} walls of thine house.
	
	Thy children like the olive \textbf{bran}ches * round a\textbf{bout} thy table.
	
	Lo, thus shall the man be \textbf{bles}sed * that \textbf{fear}eth the Lord.
	
	The Lord from out of Zion shall so \textbf{bless} thee * that thou shalt see Jerusalem in prosperity \textbf{all} thy life long.
	
	Yea, that thou shalt see the children's \textbf{child}ren * and peace \textbf{up}on Israel.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
