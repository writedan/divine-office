I call with my whole heart * hear me, O Lord, I will keep thy statutes.

Yea, even unto thee do I call * help me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

Early in the morning do I cry unto thee * for in thy word is my trust.

Mine eyes prevent the night watches * that I might be occupied in thy word.

Hear my voice, O Lord, according unto thy loving-kindness * quicken me, according to thy judgments.

They draw nigh who of malice persecute me * and are far from thy law.

Be thou nigh at hand, O Lord * for all thy commandments are true.

As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since * that thou hast grounded them forever.

O consider mine adversity, and deliver me * for I do not forget thy law.

Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me * quicken me according to thy word.

Salvation is far from the ungodly * for they regard not thy statutes.

Great is thy mercy, O Lord * quicken me, as thou art wont.

Many there are who trouble me and persecute me * yet I do not swerve from thy testimonies.

It grieveth me when I see the transgressors * because they keep not thy law.

Consider, O Lord, how I love thy commandments * O quicken me, according to thy loving-kindness.

Thy word is true from everlasting * all the judgments of thy righteousness endure forevermore.
