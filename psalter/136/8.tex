	As for our harps, we hanged \textbf{them} up * upon the \textbf{trees} that are therein.
	
	For they that led us away captive required of us then a song and melody in our \textbf{hea}viness * Sing us one of the \textbf{songs} of Zion.
	
	How shall we sing the \textbf{Lord's} song * \textbf{in} a strange land?
	
	If I forget thee, O Je\textbf{ru}salem * let my right hand for\textbf{get} her cunning.
	
	If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof \textbf{of} my mouth * yea, if I prefer not Jerusalem a\textbf{bove} my chief joy.
	
	Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Je\textbf{ru}salem * how they said, Down with it, down it, \textbf{e}ven to the ground.
	
	O daughter of Babylon, wasted with \textbf{mis}ery * yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee, as \textbf{thou} hast served us.
	
	Blessed shall he be that taketh thy \textbf{child}ren * and throweth \textbf{them} against the stones.
