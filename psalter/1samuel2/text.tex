My heart rejoiceth in the Lord * mine horn is exalted in the Lord.

My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies * because I rejoice in thy salvation.

There is none holy as the Lord * for there is no one beside thee; neither is there any rock like our God.

Talk no more so exceedingly proudly * let not arrogancy come out of your mouth.

For the Lord is a God of knowledge * and by him actions are weighed.

The bows of the mighty men are broken * and they who stumbled are girded with strength.

They who were full have hired out themselves for bread * and they who were hungry ceased.

So that the barren hath born seven * and she who hath many children is waxed feeble.

The Lord killeth, and maketh alive * he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich * he bringeth low, and lifteth high.

He raiseth up the poor out of the dust * and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill.

To set them among princes * and to make them inherit the throne of glory.

For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's * and he hath set the world upon them.

He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness * for by strength shall no man prevail.

The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces * out of heaven shall he thunder upon them.

The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth * and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his annointed\footnote{The Latin reads \textit{Christi tui.}}.
