The King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord * exceedingly glad shall he be of thy salvation.

Thou hast given him his heart's desire * and hast not denied him the request of his lips.

For thou shall prevent him with the blessings of goodness * and shall set a crown of pure gold upon his head.

He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life * even forever and ever.

His honor is great in thy salvation * glory and great worship shall thou lay upon him.

For thou shalt given him everlasting felicity * and make him glad with the joy of thy countenance.

And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord * and in the mercy of the most High he shall not miscarry.

All thine enemies shall feel thy hand * thy right and shall find out them who hate thee.

Thou shall make them like a fiery oven in the time of thy wrath * the Lord shall destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.

Their fruit shall thou root out of the earth * and their seed from among the children of men.

For they intended mischief against thee * and imagined such a device as they are not able to perform.

Therefore shall thou put them to flight * and the strings of thy bow shall thou make ready against the face of them.

Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thine own strength * so will we sing, and praise thy power.
