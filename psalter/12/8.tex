	How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed \textbf{in} my heart? * how long shall mine enemies \textbf{tri}umph over me?
	
	Consider, and hear me, O \textbf{Lord} my God * lighten mine eyes, that \textbf{I} sleep not in death.
	
	Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed a\textbf{gainst} him * for if I be cast down, they who trouble me \textbf{will} rejoice at it.
	
	But my trust is in thy \textbf{mer}cy * and my heart is joyful in \textbf{thy} salvation.
	
	I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly \textbf{with} me * yea, I will praise the Name \textbf{of} the Lord most High.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
