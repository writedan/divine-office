How long wilt thou utterly forget me, O Lord? * how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart? * how long shall mine enemies triumph over me?

Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God * lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death.

Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him * for if I be cast down, they who trouble me will rejoice at it.

But my trust is in thy mercy * and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.

I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me * yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord most High.
