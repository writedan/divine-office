Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners * and hath not sat in the chair of pestilence.

But his delight is in the law of the Lord * and in his law will he exercise himself day and night.

And he shall be like a tree planted by the running waters * who will bring forth his fruit in due season.

His leaf also shall not wither * and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

As for the ungodly, it is not so with them * but they are like the chaff, which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth.

Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment * neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous * and the way of the ungodly shall perish.
