	But his delight is in the \textbf{law} of \textbf{the} Lord * and in his law will he exercise him\textbf{self} day and night.
	
	And he shall be like a tree planted by the \textbf{run}ning \textbf{wa}ters * who will bring forth his fruit in \textbf{due} season.
	
	His leaf also \textbf{shall} not \textbf{wi}ther * and whatsoever he doeth \textbf{shall} prosper.
	
	As for the ungodly, it is \textbf{not} so \textbf{with} them * but they are like the chaff, which the wind driveth away from the \textbf{face} of the earth.
	
	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand \textbf{in} the \textbf{judg}ment * neither the sinners in the congregation of \textbf{the} righteous.
	
	But the Lord knoweth the \textbf{way} of the \textbf{right}eous * and the way of the ungodly \textbf{shall} perish.
	
	Glory be to the \textbf{Fa}ther, and \textbf{t}o the Son * and to the Ho\textbf{ly} Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er \textbf{shall} be * world without \textbf{end}. Amen.
