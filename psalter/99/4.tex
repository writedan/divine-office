	Be ye sure that \textbf{the} Lord he is God * it is he who hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the \textbf{sheep} of his pasture.
	
	O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and in\textbf{to} his courts with praise * be thankful unto him, and \textbf{speak} good of his Name.
	
	For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is \textbf{ev}erlasting * and his truth endureth from generation \textbf{to} generation.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
