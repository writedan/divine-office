O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands * serve the Lord with gladness, and come before his presence with song.

Be ye sure that the Lord he is God * it is he that hath made us, and now we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise * be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.

For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting * and his truth endureth from generation to generation.
