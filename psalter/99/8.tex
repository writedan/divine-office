	Be ye sure that the Lord \textbf{he} is God * it is he who hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep \textbf{of} his pasture.
	
	O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his \textbf{courts} with praise * be thankful unto him, and \textbf{speak} good of his Name.
	
	For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is ever\textbf{las}ting * and his truth endureth from generation to \textbf{ge}neration.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
