#title "A Psalm of David: For a Thanksgiving"

Shout with jubilation unto God, all the earth * serve the Lord with gladness.

Come before His presence with rejoicing and know ye that the Lord Himself is our God * it is He Who hath made us, and not we ourselves.

We are His people and the sheep of His pasture + enter into His gates with thanksgiving * into His courts with hymns, give thanks unto Him.

Praise His name, for the Lord is good + His mercy endureth forever * and His truth unto generation and generation.
