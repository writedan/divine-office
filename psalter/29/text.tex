I will magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me * and not made my foes to triumph over me.

O Lord my God, I cried unto thee * and thou hast saved me.

Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell * thou hast kept my life from them who go down into the pit.

Sing praise unto the Lord, O ye saints * and give thanks unto him for a remembrance of his holiness.

For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye * heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved * thou, Lord, of thy goodness hast made strong as a mountain.

Thou didst turn thy face from me * and I was then troubled.

Then cried I unto thee, O Lord * and gat me to my Lord right humbly.

What profit is there in my blood * when I go down into the pit?

Shall the dust give thanks unto thee? * or shall it declare they truth?

Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me * Lord, be thou my helper.

Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy * thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.

Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing * O my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever.
