	O Lord my God, \textbf{I} cried unto thee * and thou hast saved \textbf{me}.
	
	Thou, Lord, hast brought \textbf{my} soul out of hell * thou hast kept my life from them who go down into \textbf{the} pit.
	
	Sing praise unto \textbf{the} Lord, O ye saints * and give thanks unto him for a remembrance of his ho\textbf{li}ness.
	
	For his wrath endureth but the \textbf{twink}ling of an eye * heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the mor\textbf{ning}.
	
	And in my prosperity I said, I shall \textbf{ne}ver be moved * thou, Lord, of thy goodness hast made strong as a moun\textbf{tain}.
	
	Thou didst \textbf{turn} thy face from me * and I was then trou\textbf{bled}.
	
	Then cried I \textbf{un}to thee, O Lord * and gat me to my Lord right hum\textbf{bly}.
	
	What profit \textbf{is} there in my blood * when I go down into \textbf{the} pit?
	
	Shall the dust \textbf{give} thanks unto thee? * or shall it declare \textbf{thy} truth?
	
	Hear, O Lord, and have mer\textbf{cy} upon me * Lord, be thou my hel\textbf{per}.
	
	Thou hast turned my hea\textbf{vi}ness into joy * thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with glad\textbf{ness}.
	
	Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise \textbf{with}out ceasing * O my God, I will give thanks unto thee forev\textbf{er}.
