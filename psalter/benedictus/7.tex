	And hath raised up a mighty sal\textbf{va}tion for us * in the house of his \textbf{ser}vant David.
	
	As he spake by the mouth of his \textbf{ho}ly Prophets * which have been \textbf{since} the world \textbf{be}gan.
	
	That we should be saved \textbf{from} our enemies * and from the hand of \textbf{all} that hate us.
	
	To perform the mercy promised to \textbf{our} forefathers * and to remember his \textbf{ho}ly covenant.
	
	To perform the oath which he sware to our \textbf{fore}father Abraham * that \textbf{he} would give us.
	
	That we being delivered out of the \textbf{hand} of our enemies * might \textbf{serve} him without fear.
	
	In holiness and righteous\textbf{ness} before him * all the \textbf{days} of our life.
	
	And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet \textbf{of} the Highest * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord \textbf{to} prepare his ways.
	
	To give knowledge of salvation un\textbf{to} his people * for the re\textbf{mi}ssion of their sins.
	
	Through the tender \textbf{mer}cy of our God * whereby the dayspring from on high hath \textbf{vis}ited us.
	
	To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the \textbf{sha}dow of death * and to guide our feet in\textbf{to} the way of peace.
	
	Glory be to the \textbf{Fa}ther, and to the Son * and \textbf{to} the Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
