	And hath raised up a mighty salvation \textbf{for} us * in the house of his \textbf{ser}vant David.
	
	As he spake by the mouth of his holy \textbf{Pro}phets *  which have been since \textbf{the} world began.
	
	That we should be saved from our en\textbf{e}mies *  and from the hand of \textbf{all} who hate us.
	
	To perform the mercy promised to our fore\textbf{fa}thers * and to remember his \textbf{ho}ly covenant.
	
	To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather A\textbf{bra}ham *  that \textbf{he} would give us.
	
	That we being delivered out of the hand of our en\textbf{e}mies *  might serve \textbf{him} without fear.
	
	In holiness and righteousness be\textbf{fore} him *  all \textbf{the} days of our life.
	
	And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the \textbf{High}est * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord \textbf{to} prepare his ways.
	
	To give knowledge of salvation unto his \textbf{peo}ple *  for the re\textbf{mis}sion of their sins.
	
	Through the tender mercy of \textbf{our} God * whereby the dayspring from on high hath \textbf{vi}sited us.
	
	To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow \textbf{of} death * and to guide our feet in\textbf{to} the way of peace.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son *  and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be *  world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
