	And hath raised up a mighty salvation \textbf{for} us * in the house of his ser\textbf{vant} David.
	
	As he spake by the mouth of his holy \textbf{Pro}phets *  which have been since \textbf{the} world began.
	
	That we should be saved from our \textbf{en}emies *  and from the hand of all \textbf{that} hate us.
	
	To perform the mercy promised to our \textbf{fore}fathers * and to remember his ho\textbf{ly} covenant.
	
	To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather \textbf{A}braham *  that he \textbf{would} give us.
	
	That we being delivered out of the hand of our \textbf{en}emies *  might serve him \textbf{with}out fear.
	
	In holiness and righteousness be\textbf{fore} him *  all the \textbf{days} of our life.
	
	And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the \textbf{High}est * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to \textbf{pre}pare his ways.
	
	To give knowledge of salvation unto his \textbf{peo}ple *  for the remis\textbf{sion} of their sins.
	
	Through the tender mercy \textbf{of} our God * whereby the dayspring from on high hath vi\textbf{si}ted us.
	
	To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow \textbf{of} death * and to guide our feet into \textbf{the} way of peace.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son *  and to the Ho\textbf{ly} Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be *  world without \textbf{end}. Amen.
