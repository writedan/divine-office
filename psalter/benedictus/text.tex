Blessed be the Lord God of Israel * for he hath visited and redeemed his people.

And hath raised up a mighty salvation for us * in the house of his servant David.

As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets * which have been since the world began.

That we should be saved from our enemies * and from the hand of all that hate us.

To perform the mercy promised to our forefathers * and to remember his holy covenant.

To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather Abraham * that he would give us.

That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies * might serve him without fear.

In holiness and righteousness before him * all the days of our life.

And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways.

To give knowledge of salvation unto his people * for the remission of their sins.

Through the tender mercy of our God * whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us.

To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death * and to guide our feet into the way of peace.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
