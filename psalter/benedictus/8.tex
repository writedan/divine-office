	And hath raised up a mighty salvation \textbf{for} us * in the house of his \textbf{ser}vant David.
	
	As he spake by the mouth of his holy \textbf{Pro}phets * which have been \textbf{since} the world began.
	
	That we should be saved from our \textbf{en}emies * and from the hand of \textbf{all} who hate us.
	
	To perform the mercy promised to our \textbf{fore}fathers * and to remember his \textbf{ho}ly covenant.
	
	To perform the oath which he sware to our forefather \textbf{A}braham *  that \textbf{he} would give us.
	
	That we being delivered out of the hand of our \textbf{en}emies * might serve \textbf{him} without fear.
	
	In holiness and righteousness be\textbf{fore} him * all \textbf{the} days of our life.
	
	And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the \textbf{High}est * for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord \textbf{to} prepare his ways.
	
	To give knowledge of salvation unto his \textbf{peo}ple * for the re\textbf{mis}sion of their sins.
	
	Through the tender mercy \textbf{of} our God * whereby the dayspring from on high hath \textbf{vi}sited us.
	
	To give light to them who sit in darkness and in the shadow \textbf{of} death * and to guide our feet in\textbf{to} the way of peace.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
