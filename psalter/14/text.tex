Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest upon thy holy mountain?

Even he who leadeth an uncorrupt life * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.

He who hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbor * and hath not slandered his neighbor.

He who setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes * and maketh much of them who fear the Lord.

He who sweareth unto his neighbor, and disappointeth him not * though it were to his own hindrance.

He who hath not given his money upon usury * nor taken a reward against the innocent.

Whoso doeth these things * shall never be shaken.
