	Even he who leadeth an uncor\textbf{rupt} life * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh \textbf{the} truth from his heart.
	
	He who hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his \textbf{neigh}bor * and hath not slan\textbf{dered} his neighbor.
	
	He who setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his \textbf{own} eyes * and maketh much of \textbf{them} who fear the Lord.
	
	He who sweareth unto his neighbor, and disappointeth \textbf{him} not * though it were to \textbf{his} own hindrance.
	
	He who hath not given his money upon \textbf{u}sury * nor taken a reward a\textbf{gainst} the innocent.
	
	Whoso doeth \textbf{these} things * shall ne\textbf{ver} be shaken.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
