	For \textbf{he} hath re\textbf{gar}ded * the lowliness of \textbf{his} handmaiden.
	
	For be\textbf{hold}, from \textbf{hence}forth * all generations shall \textbf{call} me blessed.
	
	For he that is mighty hath \textbf{mag}ni\textbf{fied} me * and ho\textbf{ly} is his Name.
	
	And his mercy is on \textbf{them} that \textbf{fear} him * throughout all \textbf{gen}erations.
	
	He hath shewed \textbf{strength} with \textbf{his} arm * he hath scattered the proud in the imagina\textbf{tion} of their hearts.
	
	He hath put down the migh\textbf{ty} from \textbf{their} seat * and hath exalted the \textbf{hum}ble and meek.
	
	He hath filled the \textbf{hun}gry with \textbf{good} things * and the rich he hath sent \textbf{emp}ty away.
	
	He, remembering his mercy, hath holpen his \textbf{ser}vant Is\textbf{ra}el * as he promised to our forefathers, to Abraham and his \textbf{seed} forever.
	
	Glory be to the \textbf{Fa}ther, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
