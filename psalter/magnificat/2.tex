	For he hath re\textbf{gard}ed * the lowliness of his \textbf{hand}maiden.
	
	For behold, from \textbf{hence}forth * all generations shall call \textbf{me} blessed.
	
	For he that is mighty hath magni\textbf{fied} me * and ho\textbf{ly} is his Name.
	
	And his mercy is on them who \textbf{fear} him * throughout all gen\textbf{er}ations.
	
	He hath shewed strength \textbf{with} his arm * he hath scattered the proud in the imagina\textbf{tion} of their hearts.
	
	He hath put down the mighty \textbf{from} their seat * and hath exalted the hum\textbf{ble} and meek.
	
	He hath filled the hungry with \textbf{good} things * and the rich he hath sent emp\textbf{ty} away.
	
	He, remembering his mercy, hath holpen his servant \textbf{Is}rael * as he promised to our forefathers, to Abraham and his seed \textbf{for}ever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the Ho\textbf{ly} Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world without \textbf{end}. Amen.
