	For he hath regarded * the lowliness of his handmaiden.
	
	For behold, from henceforth * all generations shall call me blessed.
	
	For he that is mighty hath magnified me * and holy is his Name.
	
	And his mercy is on them that fear him * throughout all generations.
	
	He hath shewed strength with his arm * he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
	
	He hath put down the mighty from their seat * and hath exalted the humble and meek.
	
	He hath filled the hungry with good things * and the rich he hath sent empty away.
	
	He, remembering his mercy, hath holpen his servant Israel * as he promised to our forefathers, to Abraham and his seed forever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
