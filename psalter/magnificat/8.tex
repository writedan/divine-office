	For he hath re\textbf{gard}ed * the lowliness of \textbf{his} handmaiden.
	
	For behold, from \textbf{hence}forth * all  generations shall \textbf{call} me blessed.
	
	For he that is mighty hath magni\textbf{fied} me * and \textbf{ho}ly is his Name.
	
	And his mercy is on them who \textbf{fear} him * throughout all \textbf{gen}erations.
	
	He hath shewed strength \textbf{with} his arm * he hath scattered the proud in the imagi\textbf{na}tion of their hearts.
	
	He hath put down the mighty \textbf{from} their seat * and hath exalted the \textbf{hum}ble and meek.
	
	He hath filled the hungry with \textbf{good} things * and the rich he hath sent \textbf{emp}ty away.
	
	He, remembering his mercy, hath holpen his servant\textbf{Is}rael * as he promised to our forefathers, to Abraham and his \textbf{seed} forever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
