	His seed shall be mighty u\textbf{pon} earth * the generation of the faithful \textbf{shall} be blessed.
	
	Riches and plenteousness shall be in \textbf{his} house * and his righteousness endur\textbf{eth} forever.
	
	Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the \textbf{dark}ness * he is merciful, lov\textbf{ing}, and righteous.
	
	A good man is merciful, and \textbf{lend}eth * and will guide his words \textbf{with} discretion.
	
	For he shall never \textbf{be} moved * and the righteous shall be had in everlas\textbf{ting} remembrance.
	
	He will not be afraid of any evil \textbf{tid}ings * for his heart standeth fast, and be\textbf{liev}eth in the Lord.
	
	His heart is established, and will \textbf{not} shrink * until he sees his desire u\textbf{pon} his enemies.
	
	He hath dispersed abroad, and given to \textbf{the} poor * and his rightouesness remaineth forever; his horn shall be exal\textbf{ted} with honor.
	
	The ungodly shall see it, and it shall \textbf{grieve} him * he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungod\textbf{ly} shall perish.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now and ever \textbf{shall} be: * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
