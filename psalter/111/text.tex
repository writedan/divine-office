Blessed is the man who feareth the Lord * he hath great delight in his commandments.

His seed shall be mighty upon earth * the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.
	
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house * and his righteousness endureth forever.
	
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness * he is merciful, loving, and righteous.
	
A good man is merciful, and lendeth * and will guide his words with discretion.
	
For he shall never be moved * and the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
	
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings * for his heart standeth fast, and believeth in the Lord.
	
His heart is established, and will not shrink * until he sees his desire upon his enemies.
	
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor * and his rightouesness remaineth forever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.
	
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him * he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.
