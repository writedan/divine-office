Thy testimonies are wonderful * therefore doth my soul keep them.

When thy word goeth forth * it giveth light and understanding unto the simple.

I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath * for my delight was in thy commandments.

O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me * as thou usest to do unto those that love thy Name.

Order my steps in thy word * and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me.

O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men * and so shall I keep thy commandments.

Shew the light of thy countenance upon thy servant * and teach me thy statutes.

Mine eyes gush out with water * because men keep not thy law.

Righteous art thou, O Lord * and true is thy judgment.

The testimonies that thou hast commanded * are exceedingly righteous and true.

My zeal hath even consumed me * because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.

Thy word is tried to the uttermost * and thy servant loveth it.

I am small, and of no reputation * yet do I not forget thy commandments.

Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness * and thy law is the truth.

Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me * yet is my delight in thy commandments.

The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting * O grant me understanding, and I shall live.
