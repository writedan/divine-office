	For thou art the God of \textbf{my} strength * why hast \textbf{thou} put me from thee?
	
	And why go I so hea\textbf{vi}ly * while the ene\textbf{my} oppresseth me?
	
	O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may \textbf{lead} me * and bring me unto thy holy hill and in\textbf{to} thy dwelling.
	
	That I may go unto the altar \textbf{of} God * even unto the God of my \textbf{joy} and gladness.
	
	Upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee, O God \textbf{my} God * why art thou so heavy, O my soul? and why art thou disquie\textbf{ted} within me?
	
	O put thy trust in God for I will yet give praise \textbf{to} him * the salvation of my coun\textbf{te}nance, and my God.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
