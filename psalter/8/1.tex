	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine en\textbf{e}mies * that thou mightest destroy the enemy and \textbf{the} avenger.
	
	For I will consider thy heavens, even the work of thy \textbf{fin}gers * the moon and the stars \textbf{which} thou hast ordained.
	
	What is man, that thou art mindful \textbf{of} him? * or the son of man, that thou \textbf{vi}sitest him?
	
	Thou madest him lower than the \textbf{an}gels * to crown him with glo\textbf{ry} and honor.
	
	Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of \textbf{thy} hands * and thou hast put all things in subjec\textbf{tion} under his feet.
	
	All sheep and oxen, and the beasts of \textbf{the} field * the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea, and whatsoever walketh through \textbf{the} paths of the seas.
	
	O Lord \textbf{our} Lord * how wonderful is thy \textbf{Name} in all the world.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
