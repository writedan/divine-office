O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy Name in all the world * thou who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies * that thou mightest destroy the enemy and the avenger.

For I will consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers * the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained.

What is man, that thou art mindful of him? * or the son of man, that thou visitest him?

Thou madest him lower than the angels * to crown him with glory and honor.

Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands * and thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.

All sheep and oxen, and the beasts of the field * the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea, and whatsoever walketh through the paths of the seas.

O Lord our Lord * how wonderful is thy Name in all the world.
