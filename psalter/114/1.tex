	That he hath inclined his ear un\textbf{to} me * therefore will I call upon him as \textbf{long} as I live.
	
	The snares of death compassed me round \textbf{a}bout * and the pains of hell gat \textbf{hold} upon me.
	
	I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of \textbf{the} Lord * O Lord, I beseech thee, de\textbf{li}ver my soul.
	
	Gracious is the Lord, and \textbf{right}eous * yea, our \textbf{God} is merciful.
	
	The Lord preserveth the \textbf{sim}ple * I was in misery, \textbf{and} he helped me.
	
	Turn again then unto thy rest, O \textbf{my} soul * for the Lord \textbf{hath} rewarded thee.
	
	And why? thou hast delivered my soul \textbf{from} death * mine eyes from tears, and my \textbf{feet} from falling.
	
	I will walk before \textbf{the} Lord * in the land \textbf{of} the living.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
