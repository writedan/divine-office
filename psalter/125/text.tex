When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion * then we were like unto them that dream.

Then was our mouth filled with laughter * and our tongue with joy.

Then said they among the heathen * The Lord hath done great things for them.

Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already * whereof we rejoice.

Turn our captivity, O Lord * as the rivers in the south.

They that sow in tears * shall reap in joy.

He who now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed * shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
