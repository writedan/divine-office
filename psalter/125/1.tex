	Then was our mouth filled with \textbf{laugh}ter * \textbf{and} our tongue with joy.
	
	Then said they among the \textbf{hea}then * The Lord hath \textbf{done} great things for them.
	
	Truly, the Lord hath done great things for us al\textbf{rea}dy * \textbf{where}of we rejoice.
	
	Turn our captivity, \textbf{O} Lord * as the \textbf{ri}vers in the south.
	
	They that sow \textbf{in} tears * \textbf{---} shall reap in joy.
	
	He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth \textbf{good} seed * shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring \textbf{his} sheaves with him.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
