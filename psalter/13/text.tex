The fool hath said in his heart * There is no God.

They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings * there are none who doeth good, not even one.

The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men * to see if there were any who would understand, and seek after God.

But they are all gone off the way, they are altogether become abominable * there are none who doeth good, not even one.

Their throat is an open sepulcher, with their tongues they have deceived * the poison of asps is under their lips.

Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness * their feet are swift to shed blood.

Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not known * there is no fear of God before their eyes.

Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of evil * eating up my people as they were bread, and call not upon the Lord?

There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was * for God is in the generation of the righteous.

As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor * because he putteth his trust in the Lord.

Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Zion? when the Lord turneth the captivity of his people * then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
