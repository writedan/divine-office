	O put not your trust in princes, nor in \textbf{an}y son of man * for there is no help \textbf{in} them.
	
	For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn \textbf{a}gain to his earth * and then all his thoughts per\textbf{ish}.
	
	Blessed is he that hath the God of \textbf{Ja}cob for his help * and whose help is in the Lord \textbf{his} God.
	
	Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and \textbf{all} that therein is * who keepeth his promise for\textbf{ev}er.
	
	Who helpeth them to \textbf{right} who suffer wrong * who feedeth the hun\textbf{gr}y.
	
	The Lord looseth men \textbf{out} of prison * the Lord giveth sight to \textbf{the} blind.
	
	The Lord helpeth them \textbf{who} are fallen * the Lord careth for the right\textbf{eous}.
	
	The Lord careth for the strangers; he defendeth the father\textbf{less} and widow * as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it up\textbf{side} down.
	
	The Lord thy God, O Zion, shall be \textbf{King} forevermore * and throughout all genera\textbf{tions}.
