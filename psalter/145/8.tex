	O put not your trust in princes, not in any \textbf{child} of man * for there \textbf{is} no help in them.
	
	For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again \textbf{to} his earth * and then all \textbf{his} thoughts perish.
	
	Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob \textbf{for} his help * and whose help is \textbf{in} the Lord his God.
	
	Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that \textbf{there}in is * who keepeth his pro\textbf{mise} forever.
	
	Who helpeth them to right that \textbf{suf}fer wrong * who feed\textbf{eth} the hungry.
	
	The Lord looseth men out of \textbf{pri}son * the Lord giv\textbf{eth} sight to the blind.
	
	The Lord helpeth them that are \textbf{fal}len * the Lord careth \textbf{for} the righteous.
	
	The Lord careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless and \textbf{wi}dow * as for the way of the ungodly, he turn\textbf{eth} it upside down.
	
	The Lord thy God, O Zion, shall be King for\textbf{ev}ermore * and throughout all \textbf{ge}nerations.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
