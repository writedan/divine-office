Praise the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord * yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.

O put not your trust in princes, not in any son of man * for there is no help in them.
	
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth * and then all his thoughts perish.
	
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help * and whose help is in the Lord his God.
	
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is * who keepeth his promise forever.
	
Who helpeth them to right who suffer wrong * who feedeth the hungry.
	
The Lord looseth men out of prison * the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
	
The Lord helpeth them who are fallen * the Lord careth for the righteous.
	
The Lord careth for the strangers; he defendeth the fatherless and widow * as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
	
The Lord thy God, O Zion, shall be King forevermore * and throughout all generations.
