	Examine me, O \textbf{Lord}, and prove me * try out \textbf{my} reins and my heart.
	
	For thy loving-kindness is ev\textbf{er} before mine eyes * and \textbf{I} will walk in thy truth.
	
	I have not dwelt \textbf{with} vain persons * neither will I have fellowship \textbf{with} the deceitful.
	
	I have hated the congregation \textbf{of} the wicked * and will not sit a\textbf{mong} the ungodly.
	
	I will wash my hands in in\textbf{no}cence, O Lord * and so will I \textbf{go} to thine altar.
	
	That I may shew the voice \textbf{of} thanksgiving * and tell \textbf{of} all thy wondrous works.
	
	Lord, I have loved the habi\textbf{ta}tion of thine house * and the place where \textbf{thine} honor dwelleth.
	
	O shut not up my soul \textbf{with} the sinners * nor my life \textbf{with} the blood-thirsty.
	
	In whose \textbf{hands} is wickedness * and their \textbf{right} hand is full of gifts.
	
	But as for me, I will walk \textbf{in}nocently * O deliver me, and be \textbf{mer}ciful unto me.
	
	\textbf{My} foot standeth right * I will praise the Lord in \textbf{the} congregations.
