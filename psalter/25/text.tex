Be thou my Judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently * my trust hath been also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.

Examine me, O Lord, and prove me * try out my reins and my heart.

For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes * and I will walk in thy truth.

I have not dwelt with vain persons * neither will I have fellowship with the deceitful.

I have hated the congregation of the wicked * and will not sit among the ungodly.

I will wash my hands in innocence, O Lord * and so will I go to thine altar.

That I may shew the voice of thanksgiving * and tell of all thy wondrous works.

Lord, I have loved the habitation of thine house * and the place where thine honor dwelleth.

O shut not up my soul with the sinners * nor my life with the blood-thirsty.

In whose hands is wickedness * and their right hand is full of gifts.

But as for me, I will walk innocently * O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.

My foot standeth right * I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
