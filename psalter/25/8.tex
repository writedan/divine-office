	Examine me, O Lord, and \textbf{prove} me * try out \textbf{my} reins and my heart.
	
	For thy loving-kindness is ever be\textbf{fore} mine eyes * and I \textbf{will} walk in thy truth.
	
	I have not dwelt with vain \textbf{per}sons * neither will I have fellowship with \textbf{the} deceitful.
	
	I have hated the congregation of the \textbf{wick}ed * and will not sit among \textbf{the} ungodly.
	
	I will wash my hands in innocence, \textbf{O} Lord * and so will I go \textbf{to} thine altar.
	
	That I may shew the voice of thanks\textbf{giv}ing * and tell of \textbf{all} thy wondrous works.
	
	Lord, I have loved the habitation \textbf{of} thine house * and the place where thine \textbf{ho}nor dwelleth.
	
	O shut not up my soul with the \textbf{sin}ners * nor my life with \textbf{the} blood-thirsty.
	
	In whose hands is \textbf{wick}edness * and their right hand is \textbf{full} of gifts.
	
	But as for me, I will walk inno\textbf{cent}ly * O deliver me, and be merciful \textbf{un}to me.
	
	My foot \textbf{stand}eth right * I will praise the Lord in the \textbf{con}gregations.
