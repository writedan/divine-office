O Lord, I will praise thee, though thou wast angry with me * thine anger is turned away, and thou comfordest me.

Behold, God is my salvation * I will trust, and not be afraid.

For the Lord God is my strength and my song * he is also become my salvation.

Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation * and in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his Name.

Declare his doings among the people * make mention that his Name is exalted.

Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things * this is known in all the earth.

Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion * for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
