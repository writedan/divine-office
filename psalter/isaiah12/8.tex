	Behold, God is my sal\textbf{va}tion * I will trust, and \textbf{not} be afraid.
	
	For the Lord God is my strength \textbf{and} my song * he is also become \textbf{my} salvation.
	
	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of sal\textbf{va}tion * and in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, \textbf{call} upon his Name.
	
	Declare his doings among the \textbf{peo}ple * make mention that his Name \textbf{is} exalted.
	
	Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excel\textbf{lent} things * this is \textbf{known} in all the earth.
	
	Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of \textbf{Zi}on * for great is the Holy One of Israel \textbf{in} the midst of thee.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
