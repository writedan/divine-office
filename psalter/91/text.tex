It is a good thing is give thanks unto the Lord * and to sing praises unto thy Name, O most Highest.

To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning * and of thy truth in the night-season.

Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute * upon a loud instrument, and upon the hard.

For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works * and I will rejoice in giving praise for the works of thy hands.

O Lord, how glorious are thy works * thy thoughts are very deep.

An unwise man doth not well consider this * and a fool doth not understand it.

When the ungodly are green as the grass, when all the workers of wickedness do flourish * then shall they be destroyed forever, but thou, Lord, art the Highest forevermore.

For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish * and all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.

But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of a unicorn * for I am anointed with fresh oil.

Mine eyes also shall look down upon mine enemies * and mine ear shall hear the desire of the wicked that rise up against me.

The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree * and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.

Such as are planted in the house of the Lord * shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.

They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age * and shall be fat and well-liking.

That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is * and that there is no unrighteousness in him.
