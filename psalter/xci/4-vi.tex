	His seed shall be migh\textbf{ty} upon earth * the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.
	
	Riches and plenteousness shall \textbf{be} in his house * and his righteousness endureth forever.
	
	Unto the godly there ariseth up light \textbf{in} the darkness * he is merciful, loving, and righteous.
	
	A good man is merci\textbf{ful}, and lendeth * and will guide his words with discretion.
	
	For he shall ne\textbf{ver} be moved * and the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
	
	He will not fear of any \textbf{e}vil tidings * for his heart standeth fast, and believeth in the Lord.
	
	His heart is establish\textbf{ed}, and will not shrink * until he sees his desire upon his enemies.
	
	He hath dispersed abroad, and \textbf{giv}en to the poor * and his righteousness remaineth forever; his horn shall be ex\textbf{al}ted with honor.
	
	The ungodly shall see it, and \textbf{it} shall gnaw him * he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world without end. Amen.
