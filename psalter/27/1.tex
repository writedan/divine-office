	Hear the voice of my humble petition, when I cry un\textbf{to} thee * when I hold up my hands towards the mercy-seat of thy \textbf{ho}ly temple.
	
	O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked \textbf{do}ers * who speak friendly to their neighbors, but imagine \textbf{mis}chief in their hearts.
	
	Reward them according to \textbf{their} deeds * and according to the wickedness of their \textbf{own} inventions.
	
	Recompense them after the work of \textbf{their} hands * pay them that \textbf{which} they have deserved.
	
	For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of \textbf{his} hands * therefore shall he break them down, \textbf{and} not build them up.
	
	Praised be \textbf{the} Lord * for he hath heard the voice of my hum\textbf{ble} petitions.
	
	The Lord is my strength, and my shield, my heart hath trusted in him, and I \textbf{am} helped * therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song \textbf{will} I praise him.
	
	The Lord is \textbf{my} strength * and he is the wholesome defense of \textbf{his} Anointed.
	
	O save thy people, and bless thine inhe\textbf{ri}tance * govern them, and lift them \textbf{up} forever.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
