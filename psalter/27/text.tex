Unto thee will I cry, O Lord, my strength * think no scorn of me, lest, if thou make as though thou hearest not, I become like them who go down into the pit.

Hear the voice of my humble petition, when I cry unto thee * when I hold up my hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.

O pluck me not away, neither destroy me with the ungodly and wicked doers * who speak friendly to their neighbors, but imagine mischief in their hearts.

Reward them according to their deeds * and according to the wickedness of their own inventions.

Recompense them after the work of their hands * pay them that which they have deserved.

For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands * therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.

Praised be the Lord * for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.

The Lord is my strength, and my shield, my heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped * therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise him.

The Lord is my strength * and he is the wholesome defense of his Anointed.

O save thy people, and bless thine inheritance * govern them, and lift them up forever.
