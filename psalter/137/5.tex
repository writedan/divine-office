	I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy loving-kindness \textbf{and} truth * for thou hast magnified thy Name, and thy \textbf{Word} a\textbf{bove} all things.
	
	When I called upon thee, thou \textbf{heard}est me * and enduedst my \textbf{soul} with \textbf{much} strength.
	
	All the kings of the earth shall praise \textbf{thee}, O Lord * for they have heard the \textbf{words} of \textbf{thy} mouth.
	
	Yea, they shall sing of the ways \textbf{of} the Lord * that great is the \textbf{glo}ry \textbf{of} the Lord.
	
	For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the \textbf{low}ly * as for the proud, he beholdeth \textbf{them} a\textbf{far} off.
	
	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou re\textbf{fresh} me * thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy \textbf{right} hand shall \textbf{save} me.
	
	The Lord shall make good his loving-kindness to\textbf{ward} me * yea, thy mercy, O Lord, endureth forever; despise not then the \textbf{works} of thine \textbf{own} hands.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly \textbf{Spir}it.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. \textbf{A}men.
