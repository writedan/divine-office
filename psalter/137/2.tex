	I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy loving-kindness \textbf{and} truth * for thou hast magnified thy Name, and thy Word \textbf{a}bove all things.
	
	When I called upon thee, thou \textbf{heard}est me * and enduedst my soul \textbf{with} much strength.
	
	All the kings of the earth shall praise \textbf{thee}, O Lord * for they have heard the \textbf{words} of thy mouth.
	
	Yea, they shall sing of the ways \textbf{of} the Lord * that great is the glo\textbf{ry} of the Lord.
	
	For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the \textbf{low}ly * as for the proud, he beholdeth them \textbf{a}far off.
	
	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou re\textbf{fresh} me * thou shalt stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right hand \textbf{shall} save me.
	
	The Lord shall make good his loving-kindness to\textbf{ward} me * yea, thy mercy, O Lord, endureth forever; despise not then the works of \textbf{thine} own hands.
