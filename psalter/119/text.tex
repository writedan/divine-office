When I was in trouble, I called upon the Lord * and he heard me.

Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips * and from a deceitful tongue.

What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue? * even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.

Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech * and to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar.

My soul hath long dwelt among them * who are enemies unto peace.

I labor for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof * they make themselves ready to battle.
