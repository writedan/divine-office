	Deliver my soul, O Lord, from \textbf{ly}ing lips * and from a \textbf{de}ceitful tongue.
	
	What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou \textbf{false} tongue? * even mighty and sharp arrows, with \textbf{hot} burning coals.
	
	Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with \textbf{Me}sech * and to have my habitation among the tents \textbf{of} Kedar.
	
	My soul hath long dwelt a\textbf{mong} them * that are ene\textbf{mies} unto peace.
	
	I labor for peace, but when I speak unto \textbf{them} thereof * they make them ready \textbf{to} battle.
