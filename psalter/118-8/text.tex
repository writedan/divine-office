I hate them that imagine evil things * but thy law do I love.

Thou art my defense and shield * and my trust is in thy word.

Away from me, ye wicked * I will keep the commandments of my God.

O establish me according to thy word that I may live * and let me not be disappointed of my hope.

Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe * yea, my delight shall be ever in thy statutes.

Thou hast trodden down all them that depart from thy statutes * for they imagine but deceit.

Thou puttest away all the ungodly of the earth like dross * therefore I love thy testimonies.

My flesh trembleth for fear of thee * and I am afraid of thy judgments.

I deal with the thing that is lawful and right * O give me not over unto mine oppressors.

Make thou thy servant to delight in that which is good * that the proud do me no wrong.

Mine eyes are wasted away with looking for thy salvation * and for the word of thy righteousness.

O deal with thy servant according unto thy loving mercy * and teach me thy statutes.

I am thy servant, O grant me understanding * that I may know thy testimonies.

It is time for thee, O Lord, to lay to thine hand * for they have made void thy law.

For I love thy commandments * above gold and precious stones.

Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments * and all false ways I utterly abhor.
