Lord, what love have I unto thy law * all the day long is my study in it.

Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies * for they are ever with me.

I have more understanding than my teachers * for thy testimonies are my study.

I am wiser than mine elders * because I keep thy commandments.

I have refrained my feet from every evil way * that I may keep thy word.

I have not shrunk from thy judgments * for thou teachest me.

O how sweet are thy words unto my throat * yea, sweeter than honey unto my mouth.

Through thy commandments I get understanding * therefore I hate all evil ways.

Thy word is a lantern unto my feet * and a light unto my paths.

I have sworn, and am steadfastly purposed * to keep thy righteous judgments.

I am troubled above measure * quicken me, O Lord, according to thy word.

Let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee, O Lord * and teach me thy judgments.

My soul is always in my hand * yet do I not forget thy law.

The ungodly have laid a snare for me * but yet I swerved not from thy commandments.

Thy testimonies have I claimed as mine heritage forever * and why? they are the very joy of my heart.

I have applied my heart to fulfill thy statutes always * even unto the end.
