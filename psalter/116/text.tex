O praise the Lord, all ye heathen * praise him, all ye nations.
	
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more toward us * and the truth of the Lord endureth forever and ever.
	
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.
	
As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
