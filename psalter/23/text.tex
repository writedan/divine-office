The earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is * the compass of the world, and they who dwell therein.

For he hath founded it upon the seas * and prepared it upon the floods.

Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? * or who shall rise up in his tabernacle?

Even he who hath clean hands and a pure heart * and who hath not lifted up his mind unto vanity nor sworn to deceive his neighbor.

He shall receive the blessing from the Lord * and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

This is the generation of them who seek him * even of them who seek thy face, O God of Jacob.

Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors * and the King of glory shall come in.

Who is this King of glory? * he is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty in battle.

Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors * and the King of glory shall come in.

Who is this King of glory? * even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.
