The earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is * the compass of the world, and they that dwell therein.

For he hath founded it upon the seas * and prepared it upon the floods.

Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? * or who shall rise up in his holy place?

Even he that hath clean hands and a pure heart * and that hath not lift up his mind unto vanity nor sworn to deceive his neighbor.

He shall receive the blessing from the Lord * and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

This is the generation of them that seek him * even of them that seek thy face, O God of Jacob.

Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors * and the King of glory shall come in.

Who is this King of glory? * it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty in battle.

Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors * and the King of glory shall come in.

Who is this King of glory? * even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.
