#title "An Ode for the Sons of Korah, for the Second Day of the Week"

Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised * in the city of our God, in His holy mountains.

In the well-rooted joy of all the earth is the mountain of Zion * on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

God is known in her towers, * when He comes to help her.

Fo lo, the kings of the earth were assembled, and they came together; * when they saw her thus they marveled.

They were shaken, and trembling took hold of them; * there were pangs as of a woman in travail.

With a vehement wind shall You shatter * the ships of Tarshish in pieces.

Even as we heard, so too we have seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: * God has laid her foundations unto eternity.

We have received, O God, Your mercy * in the midst of Your temple.

According to Your name, O God, so is Your praise also unto the ends of the earth; * Your right hand is full of righteousness.

Let Mount Zion be glad, and let the daughters of Judah rejoice, * because of Your judgments, O Lord.

Encircle Zion and encompass her; * tell her story in her towers.

Set your hearts upon her strength, and consider her bulwarks, * that ye may tell it to another generation.

For He is our God forever, yea forever and ever; * He shall shepherd us unto the ages.
