	The works \textbf{of} the Lord are great * sought out of all them that \textbf{have} pleasure therein.
	
	His work is worthy to be praised, and \textbf{had} in honor * and his righteousness en\textbf{dur}eth forever.
	
	The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his \textbf{mar}velous works * that they ought to be \textbf{had} in remembrance.
	
	He hath given meat unto \textbf{them} that fear him * he shall ever be mind\textbf{ful} of his covenant.
	
	He hath shewed his people the \textbf{pow}er of his works * that he may give them the herit\textbf{age} of the heathen.
	
	The works of his hands are veri\textbf{ty} and judgment * all his \textbf{com}mandments are true.
	
	They stand fast fore\textbf{ver} and ever * and are done \textbf{in} truth and equity.
	
	He sent redemption un\textbf{to} his people * he hath commanded his covenant forever; holy \textbf{and} reverend is his Name.
	
	The fear of the Lord is the begin\textbf{ning} of wisdom * a good understanding have all they that do thereafter; his praise en\textbf{dur}eth forever.
	
	Glory be to the Fath\textbf{er}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
