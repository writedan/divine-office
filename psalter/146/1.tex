	The Lord doth build up Jeru\textbf{sa}lem * and gather together the out\textbf{casts} of Israel.
	
	He healeth those who are broken \textbf{in} heart * and giveth medicine to heal their sickness.
	
	He telleth the number of \textbf{the} stars * and calleth \textbf{them} by all their names.
	
	Great is our Lord, and great is his \textbf{pow}er * yea, and his wis\textbf{dom} is infinite.
	
	The Lord setteth up \textbf{the} meek * and bringeth down to the ground \textbf{the} ungodly.
	
	O sing unto the Lord with thanks\textbf{giv}ing * sing praises upon the \textbf{harp} unto our God.
	
	Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for \textbf{the} earth * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb \textbf{for} the use of men.
	
	Who giveth fodder unto the \textbf{cat}tle * and feedeth the young ravens that \textbf{call} upon him.
	
	He hath no pleasure in the strength of \textbf{a} horse * neither delighteth he in \textbf{an}y man's legs.
	
	But the Lord's delight is in them who \textbf{fear} him * and put their trust \textbf{in} his mercy.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
