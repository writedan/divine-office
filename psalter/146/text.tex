O praise the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God * yea, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.

The Lord doth build up Jerusalem * and gather together the outcasts of Israel.
	
He healeth those who are broken in heart * and giveth medicine to heal their sickness.
	
He telleth the number of the stars * and calleth them by all their names.

Great is our Lord, and great is his power * yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
	
The Lord setteth up the meek * and bringeth down to the ground the ungodly.
	
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving * sing praises upon the harp unto our God.

Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men.
	
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle * and feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.
	
He hath no pleasure in the strength of a horse * neither delighteth he in any man's legs.
	
But the Lord's delight is in them who fear him * and put their trust in his mercy.
	
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.
	
As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
