	The Lord doth build \textbf{up} Jerusalem * and gather together the \textbf{out}casts of Israel.
	
	He healeth those who are \textbf{bro}ken in heart * and giveth medicine \textbf{to} heal their sickness.
	
	He telleth the \textbf{num}ber of the stars * and call\textbf{eth} them by all their names.
	
	Great is our Lord, and great \textbf{is} his power * yea, and his \textbf{wis}dom is infinite.
	
	The Lord \textbf{set}teth up the meek * and bringeth down to the \textbf{ground} the ungodly.
	
	O sing unto the Lord \textbf{with} thanksgiving * sing praises upon \textbf{the} harp unto our God.
	
	Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepar\textbf{eth} rain for the earth * and maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and \textbf{herb} for the use of men.
	
	Who giveth fodder un\textbf{to} the cattle * and feedeth the young ravens \textbf{that} call upon him.
	
	He hath no pleasure in \textbf{the} strength of a horse * neither delighteth he \textbf{in} any man's legs.
	
	But the Lord's delight is in \textbf{them} who fear him * and put their \textbf{trust} in his mercy.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to \textbf{the} Holy Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world \textbf{with}out end. Amen.
