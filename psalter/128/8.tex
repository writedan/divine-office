	Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my \textbf{youth} up * but they have not pre\textbf{vailed} against me.
	
	The plowers plowed up\textbf{on} my back * and \textbf{made} long furrows.
	
	But the \textbf{right}eous Lord * hath hewn the snare of the ungod\textbf{ly} in pieces.
	
	Let them be confounded and turned \textbf{back}ward * as many as have evil \textbf{will} at Zion.
	
	Let them be even as the grass growing upon the \textbf{house}tops * which withereth afore \textbf{it} be plucked up.
	
	Whereof the mower filleth \textbf{not} his hand * neither he that bindeth up the \textbf{sheaves} in his bosom.
	
	So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord \textbf{pros}per you * we wish you good luck in \textbf{the} Name of the Lord.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
