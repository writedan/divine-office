	O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine \textbf{hon}or? * and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek \textbf{af}ter lying?
	
	Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is \textbf{god}ly * when I call upon the Lord, \textbf{he} will hear me.
	
	Stand in awe, and \textbf{sin} not * commune with your own heart, and in your \textbf{cham}ber, and be still.
	
	Offer the sacrifice of \textbf{right}eousness * and put \textbf{your} trust in the Lord.
	
	There be many \textbf{that} say * Who will \textbf{shew} us any good?
	
	Lord, \textbf{lift} thou up * the light of thy counte\textbf{nance} upon us.
	
	Thou hast put gladness \textbf{in} my heart * since the time that their corn, and wine, and \textbf{o}il increased.
	
	I will lay me down in peace, and \textbf{take} my rest * for it is thou, Lord, only, that makest me \textbf{dwell} in safety.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and \textbf{to} the Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
