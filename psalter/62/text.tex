O God, thou art my God * early will I seek thee.

My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee * in a barren and dry land where no water is.

Thus have I looked for thee in holiness * that I might behold thy power and glory.

For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself * my lips shall praise thee.

As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner * and lift up my hands in thy Name.

My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness * when my mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.

Have I not remembered thee in my bed? * and thought upon thee when I was waking?

Because thou hast been my helper * therefore under the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

My soul hangeth upon thee * thy right hand hath upholden me.

These also that seek the hurt of my soul * they shall go under the earth.

Let them fall upon the edge of the sword * that they may be a portion for foxes.

But the King shall rejoice in God and all they also that swear by him shall be commended * for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
