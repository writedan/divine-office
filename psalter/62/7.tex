	My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also \textbf{long}eth \textbf{af}ter thee * in a barren and dry land \textbf{where} no \textbf{wa}ter is.
	
	Thus have I looked for \textbf{thee} in \textbf{ho}liness * that I might behold thy \textbf{pow}er and \textbf{glo}ry.
	
	For thy loving-kindness is better \textbf{than} my \textbf{life} itself * my \textbf{lips} shall \textbf{praise} thee.
	
	As long as I live will I magnify thee \textbf{on} this \textbf{man}ner * and lift up my \textbf{hands} in \textbf{thy} Name.
	
	My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with \textbf{mar}row and \textbf{fat}ness * when my mouth praiseth \textbf{thee} with \textbf{joy}ful lips.
	
	Have I not remembered \textbf{thee} in \textbf{my} bed? * and thought upon thee when \textbf{I} was \textbf{wa}king?
	
	Because thou hast \textbf{been} my \textbf{hel}per * therefore under the shadow of thy \textbf{wings} will \textbf{I} rejoice.
	
	My soul \textbf{hang}eth \textbf{upon} thee * thy right hand \textbf{hath} up\textbf{hol}den me.
	
	These also that seek the \textbf{hurt} of \textbf{my} soul * they shall go \textbf{un}der \textbf{the} earth.
	
	Let them fall upon the \textbf{edge} of \textbf{the} sword * that they may be a \textbf{por}tion for \textbf{fox}es.
	
	But the King shall rejoice in God and all they also that swear by him shall \textbf{be} com\textbf{mend}ed * for the mouth of them that speak \textbf{lies} shall \textbf{be} stopped.
