	My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also \textbf{long}eth after thee * in a barren and dry land where no wa\textbf{ter} is.
	
	Thus have I looked for \textbf{thee} in holiness * that I might behold thy power and \textbf{glo}ry.
	
	For thy loving-kindness is better \textbf{than} the life itself * my lips shall \textbf{praise} thee.
	
	As long as I live will I magnify thee \textbf{on} this manner * and lift up my hands in \textbf{thy} Name.
	
	My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with mar\textbf{row} and fatness * when my mouth praiseth thee with joy\textbf{ful} lips.
	
	Have I not remem\textbf{bered} thee in my bed? * and thought upon thee when I was \textbf{wa}king?
	
	Because thou hast \textbf{been} my helper * therefore under the shadow of thy wings will I \textbf{re}joice.
	
	My soul han\textbf{geth} upon thee * thy right hand hath uphol\textbf{den} me.
	
	These also that seek \textbf{the} hurt of my soul * they shall go under \textbf{the} earth.
	
	Let them fall upon \textbf{the} edge of the sword * that they may be a portion for \textbf{fox}es.
	
	But the King shall rejoice in God and all they also that swear by him shall \textbf{be} commended * for the mouth of them that speak lies shall \textbf{be} stopped.
