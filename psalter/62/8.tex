	My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth \textbf{af}ter thee * in a barren and dry land \textbf{where} no water is.
	
	Thus have I looked for thee in \textbf{ho}liness * that I might behold thy po\textbf{wer} and glory.
	
	For thy loving-kindness is better than the \textbf{life} itself * my \textbf{lips} shall praise thee.
	
	As long as I live will I magnify thee on this \textbf{man}ner * and lift up \textbf{my} hands in thy Name.
	
	My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and \textbf{fat}ness * when my mouth praiseth \textbf{thee} with joyful lips.
	
	Have I not remembered thee \textbf{in} my bed? * and thought upon thee when \textbf{I} was waking?
	
	Because thou hast been my \textbf{hel}per * therefore under the shadow of thy \textbf{wings} will I rejoice.
	
	My soul hangeth u\textbf{pon} thee * thy right hand \textbf{hath} upholden me.
	
	These also that seek the hurt \textbf{of} my soul * they shall go \textbf{un}der the earth.
	
	Let them fall upon the edge \textbf{of} the sword * that they may be a por\textbf{tion} for foxes.
	
	But the King shall rejoice in God and all they also that swear by him shall be com\textbf{mend}ed * for the mouth of them that \textbf{speak} lies shall be stopped.
