I was glad when they said unto me * We will go into the house of the Lord.

Our feet shall stand in thy gates * O Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is built as a city * that is at unity in itself.

For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord * to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.

For there is the seat of judgment * even the seat of the house of David.

O pray for the peace of Jerusalem * they shall prosper who love thee.

Peace be within thy walls * and plenteousness within thy palaces.

For my brethren and companions' sakes * I will wish thee prosperity.

Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God * I will seek to do thee good.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be * world without end. Amen.
