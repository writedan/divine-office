	Our feet shall stand in \textbf{thy} gates * \textbf{O} Jerusalem.
	
	Jerusalem is built as a \textbf{ci}ty * that is at un\textbf{i}ty in itself.
	
	For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of \textbf{the} Lord * to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto \textbf{the} Name of the Lord.
	
	For there is the seat of \textbf{judg}ment * even the seat of the \textbf{house} of David.
	
	O pray for the peace of Jeru\textbf{sa}lem * they shall pros\textbf{per} that love thee.
	
	Peace be within \textbf{thy} walls * and plenteousness with\textbf{in} thy palaces.
	
	For my brethren and compan\textbf{ions'} sakes * I will wish \textbf{thee} prosperity.
	
	Yea, because of the house of the Lord \textbf{our} God * I will \textbf{seek} to do thee good.
	
	Glory be to the Father, and to \textbf{the} Son * and to the \textbf{Ho}ly Spirit.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \textbf{shall} be * world with\textbf{out} end. Amen.
