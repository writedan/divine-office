	Our feet \textbf{shall} stand in thy gates * O Jerusa\textbf{lem}.
	
	Jerusalem is built \textbf{as} a city * that is at unity in it\textbf{self}.
	
	For thither the tribes go up, even \textbf{the} tribes of the Lord * to testify unto Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the \textbf{Lord}.
	
	For there is the \textbf{seat} of judgment * even the seat of the house of Da\textbf{vid}.
	
	O pray for the peace \textbf{of} Jerusalem * they shall prosper that love \textbf{thee}.
	
	Peace \textbf{be} within thy walls * and plenteousness within thy pala\textbf{ces}.
	
	For my brethren \textbf{and} companions' sakes * I will wish thee prosperi\textbf{ty}.
	
	Yea, because of the house \textbf{of} the Lord our God * I will seek to do thee \textbf{good}.
	
	Glory be to the Fa\textbf{ther}, and to the Son * and to the Holy Spi\textbf{rit}.
	
	As it was in the beginning, is now, and \textbf{ev}er shall be * world without end. A\textbf{men}.
