	O learn me true understand\textbf{ing} and knowledge * for I have believed thy command\textbf{ments}.
	
	Before I was \textbf{trou}bled, I went wrong * but now have I kept \textbf{thy} word.
	
	Thou art \textbf{good} and gracious * O teach me thy stat\textbf{utes}.
	
	The proud have imagined a \textbf{lie} against me * but I will keep thy commandments with my whole \textbf{heart}.
	
	Their heart \textbf{is} as fat as brawn * but my delight hath been in \textbf{thy} law.
	
	It is good for me that I have \textbf{been} in trouble * that I may learn thy stat\textbf{utes}.

	Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly \textbf{to} destroy me * but I will be occupied in thy command\textbf{ments}.
	
	Let such as fear thee, and have known thy \textbf{tes}timonies * be turned un\textbf{to} me.
	
	O let my heart be sound \textbf{in} thy statutes * that I be not \textbf{a}shamed.
