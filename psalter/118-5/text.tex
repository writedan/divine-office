O Lord, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant * according unto thy word.

O learn me true understanding and knowledge * for I have believed thy commandments.

Before I was troubled, I went wrong * but now have I kept thy word.

Thou art good and gracious * O teach me thy statutes.

The proud have imagined a lie against me * but I will keep thy commandments with my whole heart.

Their heart is as fat as brawn * but my delight hath been in thy law.

It is good for me that I have been in trouble * that I may learn thy statutes.

The law of thy mouth is dearer unto me * than thousands of gold and silver.

Thy hands have made me and fashioned me * O give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

They that fear thee will be glad when they see me * because I have put my trust in thy word.

I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right * and that thou of very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled.

O let thy merciful kindness be my comfort * according to thy word unto thy servant.

O let thy loving mercies come unto me that I may live * for thy law is my delight.

Let the proud be confounded, for they go wickedly to destroy me * but I will be occupied in thy commandments.

Let such as fear thee, and have known thy testimonies * be turned unto me.

O let my heart be sound in thy statutes * that I be not ashamed.
