#title "Isaiah v, 7-10"

For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah, His pleasant land. And He looked for judgment, but behold, oppression; for righteousness, but behold, a cry. Woe unto them who join house to house, who lay field to field, until there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth.

In my ears said the Lord of hosts, "In truth, many houses shall be desolate, even the great and fair, without inhabitant. Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah."
