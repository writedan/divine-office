#title "Isaiah ii, 10-16"
Enter into the rock, and hide yourself in the dust, for fear of the Lord and for the glory of His majesty.

The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon everyone who is proud and lofty, and upon everyone who is lifted up: and he shall be brought low; and upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan; and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up; and upon every high tower; and upon every fortified wall; and upon all the ships of Tarsis, and upon all pleasant sights.
