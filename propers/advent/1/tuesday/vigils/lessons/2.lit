#title "Isaiah ii, 6-9"
For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the East, and are soothsayers like the Philistines; and they please themselves with the children of strangers. Their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots. Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made. And the lowly man bows down, and the great man humbls himself; therefore forgive them not.
