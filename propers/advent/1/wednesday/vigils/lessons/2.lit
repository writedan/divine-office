#title "Isaiah iii, 1-5"

For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole store of bread and the whole store of water, the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the prudent and the ancient, the captain of fifty and the honorable man, and the counselor and the skilled artificer and the eloquent orator.

"And I will give children to be their princes, and infants shall rule over them. And the people shall be oppressed, everyone by another and everyone by his neighbor; the child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the base against the honorable."
