#title "Isaiah v, 18-21"

Woe unto them who draw along iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cary rope; who say, "Let Him make speed and hasten His work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it." Woe unto them who call evil good, and good evil; who count darkness as light, and light as darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. Woe unto them who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
