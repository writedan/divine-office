#title "Isaiah v, 11-14"

Woe unto them who rise up early in the morning, that they may pursue strong drink; who continue until night, until wine inflame them. And the harp and the viol, and the taboret and pipe, and wine are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of His hands. Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. Therefore hell has enlarged itself, and opened her mouth beyond measure; and their glory and their multitude and their pomp, and he who rejoices, shall descend into it.
