"And if any man say anything unto you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and straightaway he will send them." In Luke it is written, "Because the owners thereof said to them, 'Why do you loose the colt?'" And it was clearly sufficient. It of course had many owners, whereby it was devoted not to one doctrine and superstition, but, by whichever unclean spirits, towards various and diverse errors: unto dumb idols, even as you were led. This also all came to pass, that it should be fulfilled which has been told the Prophet says, "Tell the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King comes unto you, lowly, and riding upon a donkey, and upon a colt the foal of a donkey.'" This has been written in Zechariah. The daughter of Zion is historically all of Jerusalem, or Zion which was situated in the citadel. However spiritually it signifies the Holy Church to which Christ has deigned to come. 

By "your King" is meant, as it might be said, "Nor foreign, not different, but particular." "Gentle," that is, not cruel and savage as others. He indeed of himself says, "Learn from me, for I am meek and lowly in heart."
