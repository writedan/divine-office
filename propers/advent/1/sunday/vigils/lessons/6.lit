The prophet Malachi has something to say about each of these advents. "The Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple." That is the first advent. Again, of the second advent he says, "And the angel of the covenant whom you seek. Behold, the Lord almighty will come: but who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap; he will sit like a refiner and a purifier." Paul pointed to the two advents when he wrote to Titus, "The grace of God has appears for the salvation of all men, training us to renounce irreligion and worldy passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world, awaiting our blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ." You see how he has spoken of the first advent for which he gives thanks and of the second to which we look forward.

Hence it is that by the faith we profess, which has just been handed on to you, we beleive in him "who ascended into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end." Our Lord Jesus Christ will then come from heaven. He will come in glory at the end of hte world on the last day. Then there will be an end to this world, and this created world will be made new.
