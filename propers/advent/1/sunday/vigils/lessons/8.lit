"Go into the village over against you." That is to say it was against the apostles, nor was it willing to accept the yoke of doctrine. Thus these disciple-teachers whom he sent signify those whom he sent to penetrate the ignorant and barbarous places of the whole world, as if pitched against a fortified village, by preaching the gospel.

"And straightaway you shall find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them unto me." When the holy preachers were going out into the world they found peoples of faithless nations entangled in chains. Indeed each one was bound with the cords of their sins. Not only of the heathens, but to be sure also of the Jews. "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." The donkey, of course, which has been yoked and tamed, signifies the synagogue where the yoke of the law was drawn up; the colt of the donkey, wanton and free, signifies the people of the heathens.

"Whereon man never sat" because none among reasonable teachers has persuaded the people of the nations to receive the bridle of correction, whether that the tongue be restrained from evil, or that they be compelled to walk in the narrow way of life; none by which a garment of salvation has made spiritually warm, or has persuaded the people of the nations profitably to come together. Indeed let a man sit upon it, if such a one, by use of reason, may correct his foolishness that it be suppressed.
