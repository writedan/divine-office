#title "Isaiah i, 10-15"

Hear the word off the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah: "To what purpose is the multitude of our sacrifices unto Me?" says the Lord. "I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bulls or of the lambs or of he-goats. When you come to appear before Me, who has required this from your hand, to tread My courts?

Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto Me. The new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure. It is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; they are a trouble unto Me, I am weary of bearing them.

And when you spready forth your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood."
