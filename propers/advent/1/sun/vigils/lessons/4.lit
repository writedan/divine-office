From the catechism of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem.

We preach not one advent only of Christ, but a second also, far more glorious than the first. The first revealed the meaning of his patient endurance; the second brings with it the crown of the divine kingdom.

Generally speaking, everything that concerns our Lord Jesus Christ is twofold. His birth is twofold: one of God before time began, the other, of the Virgin in the fullness of time. His descent in twofold: one unperceived, like dew falling on the fleece, the other, before the eyes of all, is yet to happen. In his first advent he was wrapped in swaddling clothes in the manger. In his second advent he is clothed with light as with a garment. In his first coming he bore the cross, despising the shame; he will come a second time in glory accompanied by the hosts of angels.
