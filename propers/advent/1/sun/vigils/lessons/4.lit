From a sermon by Saint Aelred of Rievalux.

The present holy season which we call Advent directs our thoughts to our Lord's twofold coming. We have therefore a double reason for rejoicing because we are meant to derive from it a double benefit.

Advent calls to mind the two comings of our Lord: first the coming of "the fairest of the sons of men" and "the desire of all nations," so long awaited and so fervently prayed for by all the fathers when the Son of God graciously revealed to the world his visible presence in the flesh, that is to say when he came to the world to save sinners; the other is that second coming to which we look forward no less than did our fathers of old. While we await his return our hope is sure and firm, yet we also frequently remind ourselves with tears of the day when he who first came to us concealed in our flesh will come again revealed in the glory which belongs to him as Lord. Of that day the psalms signs, "God shall come visibly;" it is the Day of Judgment when Christ will come as judge in the sight of all. Our Lord's first coming was indeed known only to a small number of good people, but his second will be evident to good and bad alike, as is known to use by the prophet's announcement, "All flesh will see the salvation of God."
