#title "Isaiah i, 21-26"
How the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers. 

Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water. Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.

Therefore says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "I will ease Myself of My adversaries, and avenge Myself of My enemies. And I will turn My hand against you, and wholly purge away your dross, and take away all your tin. I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."
