#title "Isaiah iv, 1-4"

And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel; only let us be called of your name to take away our reproach."

In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious; and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for those who have escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass that he who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem, when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from her midst by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.
