#title "Isaiah iii, 18-24"

In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their hair nets and their round ornaments like the moon, the chains and the bracelets and the spangled ornaments, the bonneys and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings, the rings and nose jewels, the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the shawls and the crisping pins, the mirrors and the fine linen, and the hoods and the veils.

And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stench; and instead of girdle, a rent; and instead of wellset hair, baldness; and instead of a sash, a girding of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.

Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war. And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she, being desolate, shall sit upon the ground.
