#title "Isaiah xvi, 11-14"

Lord, when Your hand is lifted up, they will not see; but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them. Lord, You will ordain peace for us; for You also have wrought all our works in us. O Lord our God, other lords besdies You have had dominion over us; but by You only will we make mention of Your name. They are dead, they shall not live; they are decased, they shall not rise; therefore have You visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
