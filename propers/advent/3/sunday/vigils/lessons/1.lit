#title "Isaiah xvi, 1-6"

In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. Open the gates, that the righteous nation who keeps the truth may enter in. You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You. Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord is everlasting strength. For He brings down them who dwell on high; the lofty city, He lays it low; He lays it low, even to the ground; He brings it even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy."
