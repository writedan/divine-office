#title "Isaiah xvi, 7-10"

The way of the just is uprightness; You, Most Upright, weighs the path of the just. Yea, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, have we waited for You; the desire of our soul is to Your name and to the remembrance of You. With my soul have I desired You in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek You early; for when Your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet his will not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord.
