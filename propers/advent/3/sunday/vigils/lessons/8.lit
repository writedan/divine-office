Indeed while abiding at the streams of the Jordan he had asserted that He was the Redeemer of the world, however, cast into prison he asks if He is to come. Not because he doubts that He is the Redeemer of the world, but he seeks to know, if He who through His own will came into the world, will also of His own wil descend to the gates of hell. He who indeed by preceding Him had announced Him to the world: this same in dying precedes Him into hell. He says therefore, "Are you he who should come, or do we look for another?" as if he should plainly say, "Just as you have deigned to be born for men, will you also deign to undergo death for men, so that I who have stood forth as the precursor of your nativity, now too many become precursor of your death, and to announce your coming to hell as I have already declared you to have come into the world?"
