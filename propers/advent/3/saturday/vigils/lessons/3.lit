Indeed the same blessed John the Baptist, when he had been asked answered, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness." Which, as was said earlier by us, in the same way was called the Voice by the prophet, because he preceded the Word. Which moreover being proclaimed is revealed by what follows. 

"Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight." Every man who proclaims right faith and good works, what else than by coming to the Lord prepares the way to the soul of the hearers, that this power of grace should penetrate, that the light of truth should illuminate, that the paths of God be made straight, while it forms pure thoughts in the mind by the good word of preaching? 

"Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low." What is the name of this place of valleys called, except humble? what of the mountains and hills, except proud men? At the coming, therefore, of the Redeemer, the valleys are to be filled up, but the mountains and hills are to be brought low, because according to the voice of the same, "Whosoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted." The valleys being filled up increase, but the mountains and hills brought low decrease. Because without doubt in the faith of the Mediator between God and mankind, through the man Christ Jesus, the Gentiles have accepted the fullness of grace, and Judea, by perfidious error, where having become swollen with conceit, has perished. Every valley shall be filled up because the heart by the eloquence of humble sacred doctrine shall be filled up with virtue by grace. 

According to this which has been written, "He sends the springs into the valleys." And thereupon on the other hand is said, "And the valleys shall stand thick with corn." For in fact the waters disperse from the mountains because true doctrines forsake arrogant minds. But springs arise in the valleys because humble minds accept the word of prophecy. Now we see, now we observe the valleys to abound with grain because their mouth has been filled with the food of truth, whereby the meek and simple appeared to this world to be despicable.
