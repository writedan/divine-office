It was evident therefore that the end of the kingdom of Judea had come, which was subject to so many separate kings. It is entirely proper that not only of under which kings, but also which priests the record would be an indication, and because he whom John the Baptist would preach, would prove to be him who was at once King and Priest, Luke the Evangelist has indicated the time of his preaching by the kings and the priests.

"And he came into all the country about Judea, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins." By all of the readings it is demonstrated that John not only preached the baptism of repentance, to be sure he bestowed the same, but nevertheless his baptism was not able to give remission of sins. Because the remission of sins if granted to us in the baptism of Christ. And so it will be observed what is said, "Preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins." Seeing that he preached the baptism which would release sins that he was unable himself to give, that just as he preceded the incarnate Word of the Father with the word of proclamation, so that baptism of repentance by which sins are released, his baptism foreshadowed, which itself could not release sin. And because his word preceded the appearance of the Redeemer, himself which His baptism would anticipate, was made a shadow of truth. It follows as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the lord, make straight his paths.'"
