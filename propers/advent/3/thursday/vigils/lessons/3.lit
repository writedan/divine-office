#title "Isaiah xxxiii, 14-17"

The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrties: "Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?"

He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly, he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands from holding of bribes, who stops his ears from hearing of blood and shuts his eyes from seeing evil: he shall dwell on high; his place of defense shall be the fortifications of rocks; bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.
