#title "Isaiah xxxiii, 3-6"

At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of Yourself the nations were scattered. And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpillar; as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them. The Lord is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness. And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your times and strength of salvation; the fear of the Lord is his treasure.
