#title "Isaiah xxxiii, 1-2"

Woe to you who plunder, though you have not been plundered; and you who deal treacherously, though they have not dealt treacherously with you. When you cease plundering, you will be plundered. When you make an end of dealing treacherously, they will deal teacherously with you.

O Lord, be gracious unto us; we have waited for You; be our arm every morning, our salvation also in times of trouble.
