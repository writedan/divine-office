However, as to why he preferred to be conceived and brought forth not of a simple virgin but one betrothed to a man reasonable causes have been advanced by many of the fathers. Of which the first is the strongest, so that she would not be judged guilty of dishonor, if she, having no husband, begot a son. Then likewise in this, that in the care that a home naturally depends, childbearing would be supported by the comfort of the husband. It was therefore necessary for blessed Mary to have a husband, who would be an assured witness of her chastity, and of our Lord and Savior who was born from her he was a most faithful foster-father. And it was he who in accordance with the law would bring an offering for the infant to the Temple, and he who would at the coming of the crisis of the persecution, carry him away with his mother to Egypt and also bring him back, and in like manner would supply the many other things needful for the frailty of human nature which He had assumed.

Neither did it harm greatly if some for a time believed that He was his son, seeing that by the preaching of the apostles after his ascension it would be plainly revealed to all believers that the birth had been from a virgin. Nor should it be overlooked that the blessed mother of God gave testimony of her especial merits, also indeed by her name, for it is interpreted "Star of the sea." And herself like an extraordinary star gliding above the turmoil of the ages shone brightly with the grace of a special priviledge. 

Moreover the angel being come in unto her said, "Hail you who are highly favored, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women." By as much as this salutation was unheard of among the customs of mankind, by so much is blessed Mary accordingly worthy. Indeed truly was she full of grace, upon whom the divine gift was settled, that, foremost among women, she would offer to God the most glorious gift of her virginity where rightfully she who desired to imitate the angelic life merited to enjoy the appearence and also the address of an angel. Truly she was full of grace who herself, through whom Grace and Truth were made, was granted to beget Jesus Christ.
