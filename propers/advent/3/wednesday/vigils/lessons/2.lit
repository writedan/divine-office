"The angel Gabriel then was sent from God." Rarely however do we read that angels appearing to man are desnigated by name. To be sure, whenever it happens, for this reason it certainly happens: that indeed the same itself should suggest the ministry for which they are come. For Gabriel in fact means "Strength of God." And he rightly shines forth with so great a name, who bore witness of the coming birth of God in flesh, of whom the prophet in the psalm says, "It is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty in battle." Without doubt that battle in which he came to fight the aerial powers and to rescue the world from tyranny.
