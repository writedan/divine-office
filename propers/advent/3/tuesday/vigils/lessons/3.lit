#title "Isaiah xxx, 27-28"

Behold, the name of the Lord comes from afar, burning with His anger, and the burden thereof is heavy; His lips are full of indignation and His tongue as a devouring fire. And His breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity; and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.
