#title "Isaiah xxx, 22-26"

You shall defile also the covering of your graven images of silver and the ornament of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as a menstruous cloth; you have say unto it, "Get you hence."

Then shall He give the rain of your seed, that you shall sow the ground therewith, and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day shall your cattle feed in large pastures. The oxen likewise and the young donkeys who till the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the greaet slaughter, when the towers fall. Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord binds up the breach of His people and heals the stroke of their wound.
