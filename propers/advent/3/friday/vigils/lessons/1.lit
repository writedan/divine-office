A homily of the Venerable Bede.

The reading of the holy Gospel declares to us that the beginning of our redemption is always to be venerated and it commends to us the saving remedies of humility that are always to be imitated. Now because at the touch of the plague of pride the human race had perished, it was fitting that the time of salvation should have first begun with the appearing of the medicine of humility by which it might be healed. And because through the temerity of a woman who was led astray, death had entered into the world, it was fitting that as evidence of returning life, women should have preceded one another in services of devout humility and piety.

Therefore before showing us the sublimity of the heavenly homeland, the blessed mother of God first showed the path of humility, not less an example of devotion than of venerable chastity. If indeed the glory of the virginal and inviolate body indicates what kind of life should be found in the heavenly city to which we aaspire, where they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven, it also indicates the extraordinary strength of mind, by which we ought to attain to it.
