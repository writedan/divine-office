#title "Isaiah xi, 10-12"

And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, who shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles sekk, and His rest shall be glorious. And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set His hand against the second time to recover the remnant of His people who shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. And He shall setup an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
