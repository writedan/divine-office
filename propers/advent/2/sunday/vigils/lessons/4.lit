From the commentary on the prophecies of Isaiah of Saint Jerome.

"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse." From the beginning of the book of this prophet until the thirteenth chapter, where commences the vision, or burden of Babylon, the whole vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, is one continual prophecy of Christ. We must explain it part by part, for if we were to take it all at once, the memory of the reader would be confused.

According to the Jewish commentators, the rod and the branch both relate to the Lord Himself. They take the rod to mean the scepter of his royal dominion, and the branch or flower the loveliness of his beauty. We, however, understand that the rod out of the root of Jesse signifies the holy virgin Mary. She was a clean stem that had as yet put forth no shoot; as we have read above, "Behold, the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son." And the branch or flower we believe to mean the Lord our Redeemer, who has elsewhere compared himself to a flower: "I am a flower of the plain, and a lily of the valleys."
