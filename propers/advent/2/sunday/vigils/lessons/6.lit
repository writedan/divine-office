"He will not judge according to the vision of his eyes." We refer this to the first coming of the Savior, while the Jews contend that it will happen at the end of the world. For he does not show partiality in judgment but speaks to the scribes, Pharisees, and rulers, "Woe to you, hypocrites," and, "The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits." 

Nor did he rebuke according to speech or to the hearing of the ears. For when they said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you are not concerned with anyone, for you do not regard the person of men", knowing their malice, he responded, "Why do you test me, hypocrites?" and similar things to these. But he judged the poor in spirit in righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven, and corrected the meek and humble of the earth with fairness, saying to the apostles, "Are you still without understanding?" and again, "Do you not yet perceive or understand?"
