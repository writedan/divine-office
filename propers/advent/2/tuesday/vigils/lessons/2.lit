#title "Isaiah xiv, 3-6"

And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give you rest form your sorrow and from your fear and from the hard bondage wherein tou were made to serve, that you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, "How has the oppressor ceased! The golden city ceased! The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers. He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he who ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted relentless."
