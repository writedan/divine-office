#title "Isaiah xvi, 6-8"

We have heard of the pride of Moab, he is very proud even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath; but his lies shall not be so. Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl; for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall your mourn; surely they are striken. For the fields of Heshborn languish, and the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof. They are come even unto Jazer; they wandered through the wilderness; her brnaches are stretched out; they are gone over the sea.
