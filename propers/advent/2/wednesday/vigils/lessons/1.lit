#title "Isaiah xvi, 1-4"

Send the lamb to the ruler of the land, from Sela of the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. For it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

"Take councsel, execute judgment; make your shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts, betray not him who wanders. Let My outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be a covert to them from the face of the despoiler; for the extortioner is at an end, the despoiler ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land."
