#title "Isaiah xxiv, 3-6"

The lander shall be utterly emptied and utterly despoiled; for the Lord has spoken this word. The earth mourns and fades away; the world languishes and fades away; the haughty people of the earth do languish. 

The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore has the curse devoured the earth, and they who dwell therein are made desolate; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
