#title "Isaiah xv, 1-4"

O Lord, You are my God, and I will exalt You; I will praise Your name, for You have done wonderful things; Your counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. For You have have made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be rebuilt. Therefore shall the strong people glorify You; the city of the terrible nations shall fear You. For You have been a strenfth to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
