#title "Isaiah xix, 3-6"

A"nd the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof; and they shall seek ths idols and the charmers, and them who have familiar spirits and the wizards. And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord, and a fierce king shall rule over them", says the Lord, the Lord of hosts. 

And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up. And they shall turn the rivers far away, and the brooks of defense shall be emptied and dried up; the reeds and the flags shall wither.
