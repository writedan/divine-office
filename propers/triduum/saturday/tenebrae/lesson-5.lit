How far did they carry their searchings, those searchings which they failed to search out, even to this, that when the Lord was dead and buried, they set a watch over the sepulchre? For theys aid to Pilate, That deceiver, by this name the Lord Jesus Christ was named, to the comfort of his servants, when they are ~named de`ceivers: that deceiver, say they to Pilate, said whilst he was yet alive, After three days I ^will `rise again.

Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is ~risen `from the dead: so the last error shall be ^worse `than the first.

Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as ^sure `as ye can.

So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and set~ting a watch.
