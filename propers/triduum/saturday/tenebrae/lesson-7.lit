Lessons from the epistle of Saint Paul the Apostle to the `Hebrews.

But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not ~of this `building: neither by blood of goats and salves, but by his own blood he entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemp^tion `for us.

For is the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinklnig the unclean, sanctifieth to the puri~fying `of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the ~living God?
