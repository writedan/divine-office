For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of salves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the ~people, `saying: This is the blood of the testament which God hath en^joined `unto to.

Moreover he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of ^the `ministry.

And almost all things are by ~the law `purged with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no re~demption.
