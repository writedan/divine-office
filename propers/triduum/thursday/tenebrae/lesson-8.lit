#title "1 Corinthians xi, 23"

For I have received of the Lord that which also I deliverd unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he ~was be`trayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you, this do in re^mem`brance of me.

After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new tes~tament `in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in re^mem`brance of me.

For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death un~til he come.
