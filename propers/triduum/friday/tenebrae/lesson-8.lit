#title "Hebrews iv, 16 - v, 3"

Let us therecome come bodly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help ^in `time of need.

For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sa~crifices for sins: who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them who err, for that he himself also is compassed with ^in`firmity.

And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to of~fer for sins.
