It must not be overlooked that one evangelist saith that the Lord was crucified at ~the sixth `hour: and another at the ^third `hour.

Indeed it is said that at the beginning of the sixth hour Pilate sat down in the judgent seat, and in fact when the Lord was lift~ed up `on the tree: it was the ^sixth `hour.

But another evangelist perceiving the mind of the Jews, how they wished themselves to be seen as innocent of ~the death `of the Lord: sheweth them to be guilty by saying the Lord was crucified at the ^third `hour.

But considering the order of the narrative, how many ~things might `have been done: when the Lord was being accused before Pilate that he ~might be `crucified: we find that it may have been the third hour when they cried out, Crucify, ~crucify.
