Nor should it seem strange that the synagogue is set forth as signified by the younger, but the Church ~by the `elder: for, although as far as the worship of God is concerned, the synagogue is before the Church of the Gentiles, yet, as regards the use of this world, the multitude of the Gentiles is before the synagogue, as Paul beareth ~witness, `when he saith: For that is not first which is spiritual, but that which ^is `natural.

By Peter, the elder, therefore, is signified the Church ~of the `Gentiles: but by John, the younger, the synago^gue `of the Jews.

They ran both together, because from their rising even to their setting, the Gentiles ran with the synagogue a way which to both was one and the same, nevertheless not in one and ^the `same sense.

The synagogue came first to the sepulchre, yet by ~no means `entered in: because, although she understood the commandments of the law, and heard the prophecies of the Lord's Incarnation and Passion, yet would she not believe ^in `him who died.
