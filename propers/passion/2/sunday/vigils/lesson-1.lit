Lessons from the book of the prophet Jere`miah.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant,and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants ~of Je`rusalem; and say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord ~God of `Israel: Cursed be the man who obeyeth not the words of this covenant, which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnance, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which ~I com`mand you: so shall ye be my people, and ~I will `be your God: that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as ^it `is this day.

Thus saith the Lord God, Turn unto me and ye `shall be saved.
