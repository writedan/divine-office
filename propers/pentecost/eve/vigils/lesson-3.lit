The Holy Spirit abideth eternally with the saints, who both in this life always invisibly he inwardly illumineth, and in the future introduceth to the eternal contemplation of the sight of his majesty.

But we also, dearly beloved brethren, if we love Christ perfectly such that we prove the truth of the same love in observing his commandments, he will indeed ask the Father for us, and the Father will give to us another Paraclete.

He will ask the Father by his humanity, who will give with the Father through his divinity.

Nor indeed should it be supposed that only before his passion did he ask for the Church, and that now after the ascension he doth not also ask, seeing that the Apostle saith concerning him, "Who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
