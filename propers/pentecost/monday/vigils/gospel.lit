At that time: Jesus said unto a certain leader of the Pharisees, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He who believeth in him is not condemned: but he who believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone who doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reporved. But he who doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."
