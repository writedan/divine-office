These veiled things are full of inquiries, laden with sacraments. Let us therefore follow, and let us listen to the Master revealing something from these obscurities: and perchance by that which he revealeth, we may be made to enter in. This parable spoke Jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spoke unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep." Behold the very door which had been closed: he openeth. He himself is the door. We have discerned it, let us enter in, that entering in we may rejoice. All who ever came before me are thieves and robbers. What is this, O Lord, All who ever came before me? Hast thou not come? But understand. All who ever came before me, he saith certainly except myself.

Let us recollect therefore, that before his coming came the prophets. Can it that they were robbers and thieves? God forbid. They did come apart from him, because they came with him. Being about to come, he sent heralds: but he kept hold of the hearts of those whom he sent.
