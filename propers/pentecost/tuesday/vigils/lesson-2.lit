He who entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, woe to that wretch for he shall fall. Let him therefore be humble, let him enter through the doorwar: let him come on level foot, and he shall not give offense. The same, he saith, is a thief and a robber. He desireth to call the sheep of another his own sheep: his own for this, that they would be snatched away by theft, not that he might save, but that he might slay them. He is therefore a thief: because he calleth what is another's to be his own. A robber, because what he hath stolen, he also slayeth.

But he who entered by the door is the shepherd of the sheep: to him the porter openeth. Concerning this porter then we shall inquire, when we have heard from the Lord himself what is the doorway, and who is the shepherd.  And the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name. He hath their names written in the book of life. He calleth his own sheep by name. Hence the Apostle saith, "The Lord knoweth them who are his." And he leadeth them out. And when he putteth hr goeth before them, and the sheep will follow, for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of strangers.
