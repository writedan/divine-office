#title "John x, 1-7"

At that time: Jesus said unto his disciples, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he who entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he who entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee frm him: for they know not the voice of strangers."

This parable spoke Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep."
