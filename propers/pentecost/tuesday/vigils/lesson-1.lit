From a sermon of blessed Augustine, bishop of Hippo.

The sheepfold of Christ is the catholic chirch. Whoever wisheth to enter the sheepfold, let him enter by the door: let him proclaim the true Christ. Not only let him proclaim the truth Christ, but seek Christ's glory, not his own. For many by seeking their own glory have scattered Christ's sheep instead of gathering them. For Christ the Lord is a low doorway. He who enters by this doorway, it is right that he should humble himself, that he may be able to enter with unharmed head. But he who doth not humble but exalteth himself wisheth to climb over a wall. Moreover he who climbeth over a wall is thus exalted that he may fall. 

Thus far, however, the Lord Jesus is speaking covertly, and he is not yet understood. He nameth the door, the nameth the sheepfold, he nameth the sheep. He setteth forth all this, but he doth not yet explain. Let us therefore read further because he is coming to those words, wherein he may deign to explain something of what he saith, from which explanation indeed he shall pershaps give us to understand what he hath not explained. For he feedeth us with what is manifest, he excerciseth us with what is obscure.
