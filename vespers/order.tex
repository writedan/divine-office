	Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
	
	Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

	\instruct{Turn to the \blueribbon and sing the responsory\footnote{\normalcolor{Vespers often lacks a responsory, in which case the propers begin with the hymn.}}, hymn, versicle, and Magnificat. If the first line of the responsory ends \enquote{ii.}, the lector will sing it whole and the congregation echoes; else, he intones it until the asterisk and is then joined by the choir. In all cases, the lector sings the verses and the congregation makes the responses. The precantor intones the first verse of the hymn, and is then joined by the whole congregation. The Magnificat is sung in like manner as the psalmody.}
