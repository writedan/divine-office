This project is an arrangement of the tradition liturgy of the hours even pre-dating the Tridentine reforms into English and made wieldly for the use of the general public. All offices have been put to music in English translation.

To that end, there are eight volumes, each containing six liturgical books. These volumes are:

|     | Temporale                 | Sanctorale               |
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| I   | Advent and Christmas      | November 27 - January 4  |
| II  | Epiphany and Septuagesima | January 5 - March 9      |
| III | Lent and Passiontide      | February 4 - April 24    |
| IV  | Triduum and Easter Week   | Saints days do not occur |
| V   | Paschaltide               | March 22 - June 12       |
| VI  | Time after Pentecost      | May 10 - August 7        |
| VII | August until Advent       | July 27 - December 3     |

The dates of the sanctorale overlap since the liturgical seasons move around the calendar year. Thus, certain saints days may fall within two different seasons.

The liturgical books within each volume are these:

1. The **collectary**, containing the parts for the minister, especially the collects.
2. The **capitulary**, containing the chapters of all hours besides Vigils, as well as duplicating the responsories.
3. The **lectionary**, containing the longer lessons of Vigils, as well as duplicating the responsories.
4. The **nocturnale**, containing the antiphons, psalter, responsories, and so forth of Vigils.
5. The **diurnale**, containing Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, and None.
6. The **vesperale**, containing Vespers and Compline.
