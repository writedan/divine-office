This project is an arrangement of the tradition liturgy of the hours even pre-dating the Tridentine reforms into English and made wieldly for the use of the general public. All offices have been put to music in English translation.

To that end, there are eight volumes, each containing six liturgical books. These volumes are:

|      | Temporale                 | Sanctorale                                 |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| I    | Advent and Christmas      | November 27 - January 4                    |
| II   | Epiphany and Septuagesima | January 5 - March 9                        |
| III  | Lent and Passiontide      | February 4 - April 24                      |
| IV   | Triduum and Easter Week   | Saints days do not occur                   |
| V    | Paschaltide               | March 22 - June 12                         |
| VI   | Time after Pentecost      | May 10 - August 7                          |
| VII  | August until Advent       | July 27 - December 3                       |
| VIII | Votive Offices            | Office of the Dead<br>Office of the B.V.M. |

The dates of the sanctorale overlap since the liturgical seasons move around the calendar year. Thus, certain saints days may fall within two different seasons.

The liturgical books within each volume are these:

1. The **collectary**, containing the parts for the minister, especially the collects.
2. The **capitulary**, containing the chapters of all hours besides Vigils, as well as duplicating the responsories from the antiphoners.
3. The **lectionary**, containing the longer lessons of Vigils, as well as duplicating the responsories from the antiphoners.
4. The **nocturnal**, containing the antiphons, psalter, responsories, and so forth of Vigils.
5. The **diurnal**, containing Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, and None.
6. The **vesperal**, containing Vespers and Compline.

These are the essential books which will have the main focus of activity until they are complete. Once so, I will include also books of lesser importance:

1. The **processional**, containing what is sung and said at processions before Mass and Vespers of certain feasts.
2. The **antiphonary**, containing the music sung by the choir as a whole at Mass, i.e. the ordinary, introit, gradual, alleluia, offertory, sequences, communion antiphons, and the like.
3. The **apostolary**, containing the lessons and epistles of the Mass with their graduals or other such chants duplicated from the antiphonary.
4. The **evangeliary**, containing the Gospels with their tracts or alleluias duplicated from the antiphonary.
5. The **martyrology**, containing the amplified calendar of the saints.
6. The **sacramentary**, containing everything necessary by the priest for the celebration of all the sacraments.

The divine office in its full solemnity should be a fixture of Christian life in families and churches alike. It should precede any devotion in the spiritual life of the faithful. It is what Saint Benedict terms "the school of the service of God." This project is not to forment dissent, nor in any way oppose the Second Vatican Council, but to embrace what prior generations held as sacred, to promote the liturgical life of the Church, and to indeed complete the restoration of the apostolic Church as demanded by the Council.
