This project is an arrangement of the tradition liturgy of the hours even pre-dating the Tridentine reforms into English and made wieldly for the use of the general public. All offices have been put to music in English translation.

To that end, there are eight volumes, each containing six liturgical books. These volumes are:

|      | Temporale                 | Sanctorale                                 |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| I    | Advent and Christmas      | November 27 - January 4                    |
| II   | Epiphany and Septuagesima | January 5 - March 9                        |
| III  | Lent and Passiontide      | February 4 - April 24                      |
| IV   | Triduum and Easter Week   | Saints days do not occur                   |
| V    | Paschaltide               | March 22 - June 12                         |
| VI   | Time after Pentecost      | May 10 - August 7                          |
| VII  | August until Advent       | July 27 - December 3                       |
| VIII | Votive Offices            | Office of the Dead<br>Office of the B.V.M. |

The dates of the sanctorale overlap since the liturgical seasons move around the calendar year. Thus, certain saints days may fall within two different seasons.

The liturgical books within each volume are these:

1. The **collectary**, containing the parts for the minister, especially the collects.
2. The **capitulary**, containing the chapters of all hours besides Vigils, as well as duplicating the responsories from the antiphoners.
3. The **lectionary**, containing the longer lessons of Vigils, as well as duplicating the responsories from the antiphoners.
4. The **nocturnale**, containing the antiphons, psalter, responsories, and so forth of Vigils.
5. The **diurnale**, containing Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, and None.
6. The **vesperale**, containing Vespers and Compline.

The divine office in its full solemnity should be a fixture of Christian life in families and churches alike. It should precede any devotion in the spiritual life of the faithful. It is what Saint Benedict terms "the school of the service of God." This project is not to forment dissent, nor in any way oppose the Second Vatican Council, but to embrace what prior generations held as sacred, to promote the liturgical life of the Church, and to indeed complete the restoration of the apostolic Church as demanded by the Council.

# The Reconciliation of Calendars

There are many divergences between the calendars of the prior and modern rites. In this project, I have generally opted for the tradition use, but certain saints have been given their new feasts, including all the apostles. In the temporale, I have included nothing from the modern rite. However, in general, the liturgical calendar follows neither the traditional nor the modern, but I have compiled a proper calendar for the Kent State University Newman Center, for which I undertook this project.

I began with the Tridentine, Sarum, and Carthusian calendars. I made note of wherever two had the same saint, and included all these automatically, unless they have been proven to be legends, that is, if they are not in the modern Martyrology. Of the saints not included by that measure, I incorporated a great deal still from the Tridentine, especially the early Roman martyrs as they are the seed of the Roman Church.

In total, the calendar is particularly Roman of the traditional rite.

# Brief Rubrics

The congregation, whether ecclessial or familial, should gather at some sacred place with at least a crucifix. In ecclesial celebrations, if a priest is ministering, he should be vested with cassock, surplice, and cope. Deacons should be vested with cassock, surplice, and stole. When laity officiate, let them be vested with cassock, surplice, and mozzetta.

Commemorations or memorials are never made at any hour: all said in the office pertains only to one liturgical day.

The ranks of liturgical days are:

1. Solemnity
2. Principle feast
3. Major feast
4. Minor feast
5. 9 lect. triplex
6. 9 lect. duplex
7. 3 lect. duplex
8. 3 lect. simplex

The first Sunday in Advent, Passion Sunday, and Palm Sunday can never be suppressed by a higher liturgical day; nor can the feria from Holy Wednesday until after the octave of Easter. Any minor feast or above coinciding with these days should be deferred; any lesser feast is suppressed for the year.

The second, third and fouth Sundays in Advent, as well as all Sundays from Septuagesima until Passion Sunday yield to solemnities and principle feasts. The Sunday is then celebrated on the preceding Saturday.

The first Sundays after the octave of the Epiphany and after Trinity, as well as the Sundays beginning each book from August until Advent (Wisdom, Job, Tobit, Judith, Maccabees, and Ezekiel) take precedence over all days of 9 lessons, except Saint Peter's chair and the Beheading of St. John Baptist. Again, if yielding, they are said on the preceding Saturday.

All other Sundays take precedence only over days of three lessons. But in all cases, if the Sunday cannot be anticipated on Saturday because another feast occurs there, the Sunday precedes any other celebration.
