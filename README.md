# Order in the Chapel

## Liturgical Books

The liturgical year is divided into seven volumes (an eighth contains the votice offices of the Blessed Virgin and of the Dead). Each of these volumes includes these four books:

1. The **collectary**, containing primarily the order of collects, versicles, absolutions, and benedictions used at the hours.
2. The **capitulary**, containing the chapters read at all hours excluding Vigils, along with their responsories when they are appointed.
3. The **lectionary**, containing the lessons of Vigils and their responsories.
4. The **antiphonary**, containing the antiphons, psalms, hymns, odes, and other such material, which is divided into three books:
	1. The *dirunal* for the hours of Lauds, Prime, Sext, and None.
	2. The *vesperal*, for the hours of Vespers and Compline.
	3. The *nocturnal*, for the Vigil hour.

## Ministers of the Liturgy

There are three essential ministers:

1. The **officiant** who presides over the celebration of the liturgy.
2. The **lector** who reads chapters and lessons and intones the responsories.
3. The **cantors** who intone the antiphons, psalm-verses, hymns, and the like.

There ought to be at least two cantors, one to lead each side of the chapel. One is to be desnigated the *precantor*, the other as the *succentor*. There may be a greater number, provided it is even, but these additional cantors are for the support of the choir and do not necessarily take upon any ministrial role.

The one exception to this rule is when **rulers** are to be appointed according to the rank of the feast (4 on solemnities and principle feasts; three on major feasts, minor feasts, and 9 lection triplexes; two on 3 lection and 9 lection duplexes; one on simplexes). When appointed, they perform the intonation of the responsories, the intonation of the *Magnificat* and *Benedictus* antiphons, and the inviatatory.

## Liturgical Vestments

Wheresoever possible, all ministers ought to be vested with the black cossack, white fascia or cincture, and white surplice. Rulers wear a red cincture, except when the prescribed liturgical color is black or violet when they wear violet. The officiant wears a mantle in the liturgical color of the day.

## Order in the Quire

The officiant is to be stand on the southwest corner of the quite; across from him on the northwest is the lector. The precantor takes his place at the right hand of the officiant, and likewise the succentor next to the lector. The other cantors fill in after these. The rulers take their place standing before the altar, between the sanctuary and the nave, as it were boxing the quire.

# Order of the Services

## Of the Daily Office

The daily office runs from Vigils to Compline, of which at least Lauds and Vespers ought to be celebrated. The daily office is always without rulers. Vigils here consists of twelve psalms, three lessons, and three responsories. The *Te Deum laudamus* is not sung.

## Of the Sunday Office

The Sunday office runs from first Vespers on Saturday until Compline of the following Sunday. The Sunday office invariably is ruled by two canons. Vigils consist of three nocturns: the first of twelve psalms, and the other two of three each. Each nocturn has three lessons and three responsories. The *Te Deum laudamus* is always sung and the reading of the Gospel follows.

## Of the Simple Office

The simple office runs from Vespers of the day preceding until None the day of. The simple office may either have no rulers (*3 lect. simplex*), two rulers (*3 lect. duplex*). Vigils consist of the ferial twelve psalms and their antiphons from the daily office, but with three lessons and responsories of the celebration of the saint or other holy thing. The *Te Deum laudamus* is sung and the reading of the Gospel follows.

## Of the Semiduplex Office

The semiduplex office runs in like to the simple office from Vespers of the day preceding until None the day of. The semiduplex office has at least two rulers (*9 lect. duplex*) or three rulers (*9 lect. triplex*). Vigils consisst of three nocturns, each of three psalms and antiphons with three lessons and responsories; certain days may sing all three as one nocturn with only three lessons. The *Te Deum laudamus* is always sung and the reading of the Gospel follows.

## Of the Duplex Office

The duplex office runs from Vespers of the day preceding until Compline the day of. The duplex office always has three rulers. Everything else is as of the semiduplex office.

## Of the Solemn Office

The solemn office is in every way identical to the duplex office except that it invariable has four rulers.
