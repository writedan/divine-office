	I confess to almighty God and to all the Saints that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed: through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore I beseech blessed Mary ever-Virgin, blessed Michael the Archangel, blessed John the Baptist, the holy apostles Peter and Paul, all the Saints, and you, brethren, to pray for me to the Lord our God.

	Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
	
	Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
	
	I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and buried. He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father almighty. From whence he shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of the Saints, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
